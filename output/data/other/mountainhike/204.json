        "abstract": "Dreaded by tunnel engineers and taxpayers alike, a vein of white, sugary dolomite runs from Passo della Greina across Lukmanierpass, Val Piora and the region of Tremorgio as far as Binntal in Upper Valais. Those who feel the white powder trickle through their hands at Passo Campolungo can imagine why this powdery rock was a worry to the engineers who worked on the Gotthard base tunnel. Deep in the mountain a so-called multifunction station (a labyrinth of caverns, tunnels and ventilation galleries, with trains stopping and railway lines crossing) was planned, 3 kilometres from Faido. However, a layer of powdery, sugary, crumbling dolomite, several hundred metres thick, forced the engineers to move the station. This delayed the construction of the whole tunnel and cost an additional 100 million Swiss Francs. «He who constructs on the Gotthard knows that he fights against the devil», Moritz Leuenberger, then Swiss Federal Councillor said, when work on the tunnel began. From the hikers’ point of view, however, dolomite veins are magnificent stripes in the landscape.",
