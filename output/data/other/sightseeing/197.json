        "description": "According to legend, Charlemagne discovered the graves of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula and had a church build as a choristers' cloister on the spot. Construction work on the present building began around 1100.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the Grossmünster was the starting point of the Swiss-German Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger. The theological college then annexed to the cloister became the germinal cell of what is now the University of Zürich.\n\nWorth visiting: Church windows of Sigmar Polke, romanesque crypt, romanesque capitals in the church and cloister, choir window by Augusto Giacometti (1932), bronze doors by Otto Münch (1935 and 1950), Reformation Museum in the cloister (open Mon-Fri).",
