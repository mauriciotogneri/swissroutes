        "description": "Today, Schaffhausen is one of the best-preserved towns from the Middle Ages. Take a right up there at the corner, walk along the narrov alley past the big arch. Visitors who venture out inte the alleyways to discover the splendid houses and fountains will believe they are in another age. And at times, it seems as if the bustling and jostling, the noise and the clattering, 1000 years ago still fills the air.\n\nMunot, Schaffhausen’s landmark, the colourful Haus zum Ritter, Münster zu Allerheiligen (All Saints’ Minster) as well as the International Watch Company (IWC) and also the Rhine with its river scenery are some of the highlights of a visit to Schaffhausen.",
