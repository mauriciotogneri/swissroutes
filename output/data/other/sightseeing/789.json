        "abstract": "Schattdorf has been home to Central Switzerland’s biggest pump track since September of 2017. The specially built asphalt circuit at the Grundmatte sports facility is suitable for beginners and advanced riders.",
        "description": "The asphalt pump track in Schattdorf has a unique layout, with a track-width of about one meter. The track is absolutely weather-proof. Though it can be slippery when wet, it takes only a very short time to become completely dry. The pump track is open for individual use and can be ridden on any type of bike as well as by skateboarders and inline skaters. Open daily.\n\nThere is a spacious playground right next to the pump track, with a pavilion, picnic tables, public toilet facilities, shady areas, a fountain and two barbecue sites. Firewood is made available by the local authority. The Grundmatte play and recreational facility can be reached via the bus stop «Grund». The grounds are also accessible by bicycle or car though.",
