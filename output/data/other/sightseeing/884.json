        "description": "The natural rollers, depressions and banked turns are challenging for kids and even for adults. In the Wildermeth loop, the speed can be accelerated by shifting the body’s centre of gravity. It all depends on how much energy you use.\n\nThe urban facility is located near the historic district of Biel, nestled between tree-lined streets, school and shops. The city of Biel offers pump track lessons, but anybody can use the track, even without formal training. You’re guaranteed to have fun.\n\nLength: 180 m",
