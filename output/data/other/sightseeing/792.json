        "description": "Despite its relatively small area of 270 m2, the modular pump track is fun for casual as well as serious riders. Touch up on your two-wheel technique by guiding the mountain bike through tight turns and improve your balance on the rollers. \n\nThe pump track has been located in the Nendaz village centre since 2017. It consists of marine plywood with a fiberglass coating. This is what makes the surface skid-resistant. Bicycles, BMX bikes, skateboards, scooters, and rollerblades can also be used on this track. \n\nSurface: synthetics\nSurface area: 270 m2\nLength: 50 meters",
