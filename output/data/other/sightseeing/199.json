        "description": "Chess and petanque are played on a continuous gravelled area in the shade of the lime trees. Once the center of the Roman settlement, Lindenhof hill was the site of a ninth-century Franconian palace, but turned into a fairground when the palace decayed.\n\nUnder the influence of the Baroque, a geometric design incorporating axes of coordinates and diagonals was imposed on the area in 1780. In 1861, in line with contemporary taste, Lindenhof hill became a delightful park facility with meandering paths and secluded corners.",
