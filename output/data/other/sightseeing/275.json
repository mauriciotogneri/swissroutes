        "description": "A large part of the museum is located within the original Benedictine Abbey Allerheiligen. Just like the former monastery, the museum is a place of knowledge, culture and encounter.\n\nWith its extensive permanent exhibitions and several special exhibitions yearly, a large variety of themes are highlighted in an attractive and easy to understand way.\n\nBelonging to the entire complex is also the imposing Minster, the idyllic herb garden and the largest freely accessible cloister of Switzerland. Here too, is the «Schillerglocke» a bell weighing 4,5 tons. Friedrich Schiller used its inscription (Vivos voco, mortuos plango, fulgura frango), as the motto for his famous poem «Song of the Bell».",
