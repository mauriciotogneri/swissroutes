        "description": "How do we satisfy the hunger for energy of a growing population? What treatments and medication are available to an increasingly ageing population? And what materials will we need in the future? These are challenges which mankind will have to face up to in future. In the psi forum you can immerse yourself into the world of research in a fun way and learn about the projects PSI is conducting in the search for solutions.\n\nDiscover what cosmic rain causes, discover the law of free fall in the world's largest demonstration facility or test your skill on the hot cell. In addition to the exhibits, two 3D films are shown in the psi forum, taking you on a journey to the core of matter.\n\nCall in the visitor centre to see Switzerland's largest research centre for natural and engineering sciences, or book a guided tour through the laboratories and the impressive largescale research facilities.",
