        "abstract": "An adventure forest has been opened July 2004 in Saas-Fee. Swing on a liana from tree to tree or walk unsteadily across hanging bridges: a forest full of adventure for the whole family with various routes and degrees of difficulty.",
        "description": "You move from tree to tree, overcoming various obstacles: Suspension bridges, tyrolienne, lianas, etc. At the heart of the adventure forest are the two spectacular tyroliennes over the yawning Fee Gorge!\n\nIntroduction route: The introduction route contains 9 obstacles and is obligatory for everyone. On this route everyone will learn the rules for its security and the correct use of the equipment. Duration: approx. 15 min. Discovery route: The discovery route consists of 15 obstacles for our little adventurer (from 4 years, no minimum height). The kids can be accompanied by their parents. Duration: approx. 1 hour. The long route: The route contains 3 different levels of difficulty. For adults and children (from 1.45 height and 10 years). Duration: approx. 3-4 hours.\n\nThe longest «tyroliennes» (cable pulleys) in Europe: The two spectacular «tyroliennes» over the gaping Fee Gorge are the centrepiece of the adventure forest. The longer of the two, at a dizzy height, measures an adrenalin-charging 280 metres. The shorter one, which is used on the way back, is also an awe-inspiring 210 metres long.",
