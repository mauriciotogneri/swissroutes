        "abstract": "The Axenstrasse, one of the most beautiful main roads in Central Switzerland, has been one continuous section from Flüelen to Brunnen since 1865. Thanks to brilliant technology and panoramic views, it has become a world-famous tourist attraction.",
        "description": "In addition to the Schöllenen, the Axen is a key point on the land route between the St. Gotthard, the Urner Reusstal valley and central Mittelland. The almost vertical rock faces north of Gruontal valley and the Gumpischtal and Buggital cliffs and gullies falling to the lake have long posed a great hindrance to traffic.\n\nIt is unclear whether a continuous land route from Flüelen to Sisikon existed before 1860. Traffic probably mostly made use of the waters of the Vierwaldstättersee. The crosswise shoulder of the mountain and the Tellen shores are old settlement sites. The Axenberg was so remote for so long that a herd of ibex lived on Adamsrüti until 1583.\n\nIn 1776, the route from Flüelen to Axen was called Landstrasse (country road), but the Axen did not become a traffic route until 1860, when construction of the today’s still famous road began. The section from Brunnen to Flüelen was opened in 1865. The brilliant engineering feat consists of passages blasted from the rock, galleries and numerous openings in the tunnel walls giving views of the lake, Flüelen and the Reusstal valley. Since the 1930s, the road has been successively altered to suit traffic needs. Numerous sections have been closed or now serve as hiking trails.",
