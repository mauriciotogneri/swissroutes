        "description": "The Cornamusaz family makes Ai cheese and a great many other handcrafted products all summer long during their stay at Témeley. Early birds can watch them make cheese from fresh cow’s milk of the day. Thanks to Alain's explanations, they will discover the subtleties of cooking the cheese mixture over a wood fire, as well as stocking and maturing the cheese wheels in the cellar. Located half-way between the village and La Berneuse, Le Témeley is an ideal place for a little break during a hike.",
