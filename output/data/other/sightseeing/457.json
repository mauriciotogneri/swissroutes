        "abstract": "Close to the Oberalp pass lies a quiet lake with clear fresh water, which cascades gently down the valley. The Tomasee is recognized as the source of the Rhine. And only here can you take a single step to cross over this mighty river.",
        "description": "Tomasee, at 2344 metres above sea level, is surrounded by a natural basin feeding water into the lake. This area is now under conservation. Leaving the Oberalp pass on foot, the lake is reached in one and a half hours. During the season a patchwork of alpine flora spreads around in vivid colours. And, of course, the water is so pure that it is even drinkable!\n\nHere high on the Oberalp pass begins the Rhine bike route, which follows the river all the way to Basel and even to the shores of the North sea. Not far from Tomasee lie two SAC mountain lodges, providing accommodation - a great starting point for the bike tour.",
