        "abstract": "The Goldau Rigi path, together with the Arth and Weggis Rigi paths are among the most important historic access paths on the Rigi. Its «harmlessness» made the Rigi a much frequented pioneer mountain of Alpine tourism as early as the 18th century.",
        "description": "Mountain pastures on the Rigi were in use as early as the 7th century, but first documented in the 14th century. The first chapel for the Alpine herdsmen was built at Kaltbad in 1556. Another followed in 1689 for the herdsmen «across the mountain» at Klösterli, where an initially local place of pilgrimage was established.\n\nFirst descriptions of the alps and life on the alps appear and interest grows in this hitherto hostile world. Tourism began and with it an increase in pilgrimages, particularly to Klösterli with its chapel, St. Mary in Snow. The chapel was extended twice at the beginning of the 18th century. The Capuchin hospice was occupied during summer from 1715, and all year from 1775. From then on the Rigi was laced with uphill paths, used not only by herdsmen and their cattle but also by tourists and pilgrims.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the Rigi had developed into Europe’s fashionable mountain. With the construction of the inn on the Rigi Kulm in 1816, the emphasis changed irreversibly from pilgrimage to tourism. Even Queen Victoria allowed herself to be carried up the mountain by sedan chair. The construction of the Vitznau-Rigi Railway in 1871 and Arth-Rigi Railway in 1875 triggered modern mass tourism.",
