        "description": "Two aerial cable cars transport you from Arosa to the summit of the Weisshorn. The breathtaking panoramic view from up there over more than 400 Swiss mountain peaks and those in neighbouring countries is simply not to be missed. And besides, you also have a view down to Chur, Switzerland's oldest city.\n\nSeveral trails lead from the summit of the Weisshorn down to the middle station of the Weisshornbahn cable car, such as via Carmenna Pass and on to the Carmennah√ºtte at 2'134 m above sea level, where you may enjoy refreshments. From there you'll reach the middle station in about 40 minutes.",
