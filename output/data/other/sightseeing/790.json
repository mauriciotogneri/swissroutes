        "description": "Once a tennis court, today one of the largest pump tracks in the Valais with a total area of around 600 square metres: the popular pump track in Bellwald has already lived up to its name as a playground for everyone. It simultaneously functions as an ideal meeting place because its location is perfect: on the edge of the forest, amidst the Bellwald sports and leisure facilities and close to the barbecue area, playground and a large car park.\n\nOf course, the Bellwald pump track also has a lot to offer in terms of sport: as the first asphalted facility in the canton, it is suitable for all roller wheeled means of transport. Ground contours, transfers, steep walls and a quadruple curve make it a real highlight. Tip: if you spontaneously feel like «pumping» around, you can rent a suitable means of transport from the sports and leisure facilities.\n\nLength: 200 m / Area: 600 m2 / Wave and curve height: 30-120 cm / Surface: concrete.",
