        "description": "Solothurn's clock tower. The town's oldest construction came into being at the beginning of the 13th century; commencing with the clock floor in 1467 and later in 1545 creation of the astronomical clock movement and famous astronomical clock face. The large astronomical clock announces the hour, day, month and year. Below is a group of figures: knight, death, and in the middle a seated king with fools' cap - and since 1545 the grim reaper turns his time-glass on the hour, nodding with his bald head in the direction of the knight (powerful symbol of life) as sign that «the time is up». The works were constructed by Lorenz Liechti and Joachim Habrecht. Below, the city's two patrons Urs and Viktor from the year 1583.",
