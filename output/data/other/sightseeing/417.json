        "abstract": "At the back of beyond in the «Feufliber» valley where the source brooks of the Hintere Frenke river crash over rocks into the valley, the gondolas of the Wasserfallen Cableways provide a view of the unique sun-kissed Jura countryside.",
        "description": "Magnificent peaks and mountain vistas, pure and fresh mountain air and a wealth of flora and fauna make the Wasserfallen an ideal starting point for a wonderful family excursion, sporting activities, or simply to enjoy relaxing in the peace and quiet.\n\nA wide, extensive network of paths and trails branch off in every single direction and offers everyone the suitable choice depending on their physical fitness, time constraints and current mood: from a short stroll to a sun terrace with a café to a hike with views of snowcovered alpine peaks, from educational nature trails in the valley to hikes in the Jura to lake Geneva spread over several days.\n\nExcellent public transport connections in the entire region make choosing your route easy. Start and finish points can be combined in many different ways however you wish. A number of mountain inns and picnic spots – some of them even with Alpine panoramas – provide an inviting resting place along the way.\n\nAnyone wishing to crown the day by whizzing downhill to the base station can hire a scooter at the mountain station.",
