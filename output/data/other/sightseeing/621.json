        "description": "The museum is located in the heart of the medieval castle and gives you an insight into the history of money in Switzerland, both real and fake. \n\nIn two rooms of the museum, various techniques are shown which make the Swiss currency modern and reliable.\n\nOn the first floor you will discover all the banknotes issued by the Swiss National Bank. You can follow the production of the banknotes and especially the advanced techniques that were intended to make counterfeiting impossible. A small \"euro corner\" allows you to make interesting comparisons and in a showcase you can see coins that have been in circulation in the Valais over the last centuries.\n\nOne floor below on the ground floor there is a counterfeit money zone, each with its history and the material used to make it. Here you can compare real and fake coins. An exhibition on the new national currency LE FARINET is also located on the ground floor, in the reception area.\n\nYou will meet Farinet in the basement. The famous writer Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz made him a legend by telling his story in the middle of the 20th century. The counterfeiter originally came from the Aosta Valley. After a dispute with the Italian judiciary, he moved to the Valais. There he produced false twenty centime coins. He distributed these among the people. In return he received shelter and protection.\n\nIn two rooms of the museum, various techniques are shown which make the Swiss currency modern and reliable.",
