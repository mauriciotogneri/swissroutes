The atmosphere of the Place du Bourg-de-Four is particularly welcoming, enhanced by tiny antique shops, bistros and outdoor cafes that surround a charming 18th century fountain.",
        "description": "On the hit-parade of the charms of Geneva, this square in the heart of the old town is ideal for lounging and soaking up the calm, serene and pleasant atmosphere. It is not unusual to see locals meeting around the beautiful 18th century fountain surrounded by flowers, or on the terrace of a picturesque bistro, La Clémence for example.\n\nTo the east is the Courthouse (Palais de Justice), which was first a convent and then a general hospice. It has housed Geneva’s judiciary power since the middle of the 19th century.",
