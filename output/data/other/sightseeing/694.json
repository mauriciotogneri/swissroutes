        "abstract": "The Bike Park Bonaduz is a perfect training terrain for people of all ages who want to work on their technical skills. There are sections which promote balance, single trails with roots as well as north shore elements and banked turns.",
        "description": "The Bike Park Bonaduz offers a large selection of routes and elements suitable for every level. It is an ideal place to practice and improve your riding technique. The singletracks, some of which feature tree roots, ensure an exciting experience, while the Northshore elements require additional technical skills. The berms are perfect for practising cornering and building up speed. Whether you are just starting out or are already a seasoned rider, everyone can hone their skills and have fun at the Bike Park Bonaduz.\n\nThe bike park is located along the way from Bonaduz to Versam. Take the first left immediately after the first railway crossing and continue along Sculmserstrasse. From the old crazy golf course it's roughly another 300m. \n\nThe entrance to the Bike Park Bonaduz is right on the edge of the forest on the right. Weather conditions occasionally damage elements! Please inspect the trail and elements before use! Use of the bike park is at your own risk.",
