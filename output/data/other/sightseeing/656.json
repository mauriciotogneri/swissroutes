        "abstract": "The multi-arched bridge over the Thur at Bischofszell represents an extraordinary entity in the northeast of Switzerland. The stone bridge completed in 1487 has undergone numerous alterations. The breakwaters for example probably date from the 16th century.",
        "description": "The first documentation of a bridge across the River Thur at Bischofszell dates from 1325. Construction of the bridge that stands today probably began about 1479. An agreement dating back to that year was made between Bischofszell and Bishop Otto IV from Konstanz. The origin of the obligation to build is shrouded in myth. such as the talk of a foundation by a noble lady whose son fell from an old wooden footbridge during a flood and drowned.\n\nThe bridge was completed in 1487 after eight years of construction work. Its curved line stems from the layout of the rock outcrops in the river bed that serve as foundations. The bridge was toll-free until into the 18th century. The toll approved by the bishop in 1781 met with opposition from the surrounding municipalities and did not remain in force. The massive breakwaters probably date from the 16th century. In the 19th century, the gradient was reduced and the carriageway widened, straightened and given a balustrade. Renovations carried out from 1971 to 1975 endeavoured to replicate the original condition of 1860. The original cobblestone paving with traces of cart tracksare now visible again in places.",
