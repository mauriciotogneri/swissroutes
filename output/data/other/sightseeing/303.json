        "abstract": "What does a osprey, a tropical screech owl or a Eurasian hobby look like? You can see these birds and other animals in the falconry park in Buchs AG. With an inventory of over 70 species of bird, the falconry is one of a kind in Europe.",
        "description": "On a tour through the spacious park, visitors come across the eagle, the falcon, various species of owl, the owlet, the buzzard, vultures, the kite and other exotic animals. Along with the adult birds of prey, some bird offspring are also raised. The lively offspring are a sign that the animals feel at home in the park. Even Eurasian hobbies hatched in the year 2009. This was a unique event as no young Eurasian hobbies had ever come into the world in captivity in Switzerland before.\n\nAnyone wanting to experience the birds of prey at first hand can take part in the flight show. The birds display their natural hunting behaviour in free flight in an arena with 120-person capacity. As a member of the audience, you will participate in the show. This creates unforgettable moments for all the family. Children can have fun in the playground and meet the miniature goats in the petting zoo.",
