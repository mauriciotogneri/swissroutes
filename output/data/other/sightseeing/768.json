In the water zone, the little ones can build something or go on a treasure hunt.\n\nThe petting zoo is the perfect place to observe animals up close and even pet them. The cute dwarf goats, rabbits and other animals eagerly await visitors and provide a popular photo opportunity.\n\nAlpenruhe also has a fragrant and flowering adventure garden: you have the opportunity to enjoy herbs and flowers with all your senses there.\n\nCatering is provided too: you can relax on the covered terrace and have a drink and something to eat in peace at the café. The shop has products from the Alpenruhe Foundation and is also located in the café. \n",
