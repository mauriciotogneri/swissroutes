        "description": "The Muttenz (BL) pump track is one of the first asphalt tracks in the region. Thanks to its surface, it can be ridden on a variety of bikes: even the little ones can do their laps on balance bikes, while the older visitors can use scooters, inline skates or skateboards as well as mountain bikes. \n\nThe pump track is situated right next to the indoor swimming pool and the beach volleyball court. A special feature is the integrated bowl: together with the entrances and exits, it offers a highlight for all those who want to perfect their tricks and jumps. \n\nSince October 2020, the pump track has been freely accessible and has also been actively used since then. \n",
