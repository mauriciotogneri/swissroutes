        "description": "The leisure park of La Robella is situated in the heart of the Val-de-Travers and offers numerous activities for the whole family: tobogganing, all-terrain scooters, mountain boards, or a pump track for BMX enthusiasts. The latter is 175 metres long, paved and consists of 29 bumps, 4 banked turns and 4 full circles on different levels with a 1 metre difference between the levels, measured at the hollow of the bumps. The access to the pump track is free of charge and it can be used from 09.00 h until it gets dark. \n\nOnly BMX bikes are allowed on the pump track. Scooters, skateboards, motored vehicles, remote control motors etc. are prohibited. The pump track helps you to improve your technique and work on your figures. And even if you’re not (yet) a BMX expert, come all the same, because the pros will be happy to share their passion and their advice with you. Good to know: you can rent a BMX at the pay desk of La Robella for CHF 6.00 per half hour.\n\nAre you more of a nature than a BMX lover? No problem! Take the chair lift right next to the pump track, which takes you to some marvellous hiking trails through the region. Not to be missed: the Poëta-Raisse gorges and the Chasseron.",
