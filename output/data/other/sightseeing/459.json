        "description": "Préhisto-Parc: a route of 2 km through a superb Jura forest features numerous signboards with information, so visitors can enlarge their knowledge as they admire the models, which are based on the latest findings from the world of paleontology. Above the pool that is home to the impressive marine reptiles, a suspended walkway also provides an opportunity for tightrope walking! A large observation tower, in the shape of a double ADN helix, affords a superb view over the valley of the river Doubs and its meanders.\n\nRéclère Caves: visitors walk along a 1500-meter route to discover various stalagmites and stalactites of exceptional beauty, including the elegant Pagoda and the Dome which, at 15 meters high, is Switzerland's largest stalagmite.",
