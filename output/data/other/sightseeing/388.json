        "abstract": "Cross the drawbridge into the castle and immerse yourself into the 1000 year old history of one of the oldest mountain castles in Switzerland. Schloss Lenzburg will send you on a journey to long forgotten times, with stories of governors and scoundrels.",
        "description": "At the former residence of counts, governors and dukes, today you can set out to trace their stories. In the prison eavesdrop on the tragic stories of the BÃ¤rtschi brothers or gain a detailed insight into the everyday life of the governor families. Schloss Lenzburg brings the historic original showpiece back to life.\n\nThe oldest structures of the castle date from the early 12th Century and were built by Count von Lenzburg. During the subsequent 900 years the complex was continually expanded. Today the Lenzburg encompasses a familyfriendly museum (where the dragon Fauchi lives), a representative example of a knight's house from the Habsburg dynasty and a romantic, French baroque garden. You also have magnificent views from here and can see several castles in the surrounding area.\n\nIn addition to the permanent exhibition, the Lenzburg also stages regular guided tours, medieval markets and musical events. Offering the visitors the unique opportunity to experience history.",
