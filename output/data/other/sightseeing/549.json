        "description": "Lying on the alluvial rise which originated, long ago, from the Vignoi and Sant'Anna torrents and closed to the north by the rocky ledges of the Biaschina (evidence of a gigantic landslide), Giornico represents the connection point of the Ticinese lowland with the more typically alpine countryside. In Giornico there is a continuous interlacing of nature with the works of man: the inventory of natural and cultural riches is  so extraordinarily vast that the village can, in itself, be considered a museum. There are many signs left by the creative activity of man which enrich the countryside and give a specific impression of a past history not easily confused with others. Well worth a visit many Romanesque churches and the Museum of Leventina (Casa Stanga).",
