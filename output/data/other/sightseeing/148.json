        "abstract": "The tranquil Feierlenhof is surrounded by orchards, and affords a splendid view of Lake Constance and the Vorarlberg Mountains. This idyllic farm has much to offer: quiet and relaxation, animals, nature - and unique experiences.",
        "description": "On this family-run farm you can experience everyday rural life first-hand. You can walk through the stables, feed cows and chickens, take water to the calves, care for the small animals, pet horses or ride them, and also stay overnight on the farm.\n\nThe playground is an attraction for small guests and the marvellous beach appeals to everyone. A hearty meal on the farm will make this a holiday to remember. If you would like to bake your own breakfast roll, you are welcome to join us on baking day. \nThe fruit trail leads through the orchards of Altnau.\n\nThe area around the Feierlenhof offers ample opportunities for leisure activities. You can go on walks or on bicycle tours (bicycles provided by the hosts), and there are lovely excursions around Altnau by bus, train or ship. Whether you prefer to go biking, hiking or inline-skating - this region has something for everyone. Come and explore the area around the «apple village» on Lake Constance!",
