        "description": "You first cross a notary’s study full of documents and then reach the arms room, which displays some hundred shotguns, pistols and knives. Then you will pass through the kitchen, which, having just been left by the landlady, still seems to retain the delicious smells of cooking. Your visit will then take you to the room dedicated to the countryside, its tools, its ploughs and its bells, and, after that, to the lower room exhibiting all known aspects of the ancient town, the nameplates of the Moudon cafés, as well as roof ridges and decorated tiles. After appreciating the salons with their famous painted tapestries of the 18th century, you will finally access the large common room where there are various craftsmen’s tools and matrixes used for cotton prints. An interactive scale model of old Moudon at the beginning of the 15th century (scale 1:500) is located in the heart of the museum.",
