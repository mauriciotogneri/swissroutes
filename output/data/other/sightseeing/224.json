        "description": "\"Älggi is a centre worthy of the name, \" declared the lead surveyor; traffic-free and far from any bustle, its peace and quiet  provides a perfect setting for relaxation – and perhaps for rediscovering one’s own centre. The municipality hit on a creative way to mark this point in the landscape: he local cairn enthusiasts’ club erected a wall in the shape of Switzerland to surround it.\n\nThat said, the marker was moved 500 metres south-eastwards as it was felt no one would want to visit the exact centre at the foot of a rock face. Standing on the little rise near the Älggi mountain inn, the visitor can enjoy views of the Alpboden, the surrounding ring of mountains and the midlands.",
