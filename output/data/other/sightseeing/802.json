        "abstract": "First you enjoy a unique view over the Klöntal lake, then a steadily flowing descent into the valley: countless steep face curves, tables, small and large jumps make for great fun on your way through forests and over pastures back to Glarus.",
        "description": "The Klöntal valley is situated to the west of Glarus. The scenery is impressive, with the striking Glärnisch massif reflected in the Klöntal lake. You will have the best view of the mirror-smooth water surface at the Schwammhöhe, the starting point of the flow trail down to Glarus. The access is either via Sackbergstrasse or from the Klöntal lake which can be reached by postbus from Glarus.\n\nThe flow trail back into the valley is ideally adapted to the terrain and was completely reconstructed. The surface is either natural or was built with local material. Countless steep face curves, tables as well as small and big jumps provide a lot of fun. If you are a little less experienced, you can avoid all the obstacles. There are a few stony passages, but overall the trail is flowing smoothly and not very steep. Whether young or older, beginner or pro – everyone will have lots of fun on the flow trail Glarus.\n\nThe start is curvy as the trail leads through the forest to Vorder Saggberg. Now you ride along the edge of the forest, then over a short paved stretch through the clearing on the Sackbergstrasse. A short breather is called for here. After crossing a pasture, the trail dips into the forest again and continues with bends and hairpin bends. Once you reach the bottom, the trail branches off in front of the shooting range and leads back to Glarus.",
