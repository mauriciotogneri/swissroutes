        "abstract": "The glacial erratics exhibition in Grenchen is a representative selection of over 300 glacial erratics found during the construction of the A5 motorway in the Solothurn - Grenchen region. Ten information panels explain how the ice ages occurred and from where the erratic blocks came.",
        "description": "Of the total number of over 300 blocks found during the construction of the motorway, around 60 typical stones have been put on show in Grenchen. Limestone and sandstone, etc. are on display alongside primary rocks such as gneiss and granite. Ten well-illustrated and informative panels explain how these blocks were formed by Alpine folds millions of year ago and then transported by the glaciers to Grenchen tens of thousands of years ago. The information panels explain the origins of the ice ages as well as the fauna at that time.\n\nDuring the construction of the A5 motorway from Solothurn to Biel, the Moosbach stream in the exibition area was freed from its concrete «coffin» as an alternative measure. This old, subterranean conduit also provides flood relief, which ensures an uninterrupted flow of water over the bed of the generously renaturalised and attractively «redesigned» Moosbach stream, which is now safely accessible to younger children at all times. A fantastic playground! During the reclamation of the gravel area around the stream, restoration work not only focused on native and local plants, but also on allowing large sections to regenerate naturally.\n\nThe glacial erratics exhibition in Grenchen is the only installation of its kind for miles around.",
