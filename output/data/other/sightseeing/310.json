        "abstract": "Ever since its construction the monastery of Santa Maria Assunta above Claro has been an evocative place of silence, prayer and work. This is still the case today and within its walls the nuns continue to dedicate their lives to worship in almost total seclusion.",
        "description": "Climbing up the ancient mule track to the monastery of Santa Maria Assunta above Claro in the Valle Riviera is like taking a trip back in time.\n\nIn fact, the monastery is immersed in an almost surreal silence. Inside the walls the nuns spend their days in enclosed seclusion, dedicating their lives to their faith and prayer but also to practical activities such as embroidery, honey and biscuit making, book restoring etc. The products are then sold allowing the nuns to support themselves.\n\nThe monastery stands on a rocky spur above Claro and is surrounded by chestnut groves. Its high and tranquil position affords magnificent views over the Valle Riviera. The church dedicated to the Madonna dates back to 1300 whereas the monastery was founded in 1490, thanks to the help of the church of Milan and was completely restored between 1998 and 2005. The monastery can also be reached by means of a small cable car which leaves from the chapel of S. Ambrogio in Claro.",
