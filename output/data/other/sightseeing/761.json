        "abstract": "The medieval Arbon Castle with its fortified tower offers visitors the largest local and regional history museum in the Thurgau region. The modern permanent exhibition takes them on an exciting journey through time, spanning 5,500 years of fascinating settlement history on Lake Constance.",
        "description": "As early as 3,000 years before Christ, the first settlements were built by the lake. 300 years after Christ, the Romans built Arbor Felix Castle and 1,000 years later, the municipality of Arbon was established in this place and surrounded with a town wall. With effect from the late 19th century, an industry with a worldwide reach developed here.\n\nAll of these time periods are documented with many original finds, true to scale models, pictures and photos. Here and there, they are supplemented tongue-in-cheek with comparable present-day objects. Different exhibits in the mighty tower showcase everyday life and the society of bygone times. From the tower room, you can enjoy breathtaking panoramic views of the old town of Arbon and of the lake.\n\nTemporary special exhibitions make every visit to the museum a fascinating new experience.",
