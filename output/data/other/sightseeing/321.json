        "description": "The new Parsenn train has been transporting visitors to this classic hiking region since December 2002. Since the very beginning of tourism in this high mountain valley, hikers and holiday-makers have been attracted to the area to see the «Zauberberg» – the «Magic Mountain», made world famous by Thomas Mann – and the Weissfluhjoch, at 2'663 m above sea level.\n\nFrom the Weissfluhjoch a slightly sloping crossroad runs to Casanna Alp. On this stretch of the route one can spot ibex and marmots. The trail continues through alpine meadows with their wealth of flora to Serneuser Schwendi, where you can enjoy refreshments in a lovely mountain restaurant. From there it is downhill via Cavadürli to Klosters. This trail has a stunning view of the Prättigau valley at all times (Routes number: 66/73. Duration: 4 hours).",
