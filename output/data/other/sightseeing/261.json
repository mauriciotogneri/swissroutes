        "abstract": "The Grande Cariçaie was acknowledged as a wetland of international importance already in 1976. It comprises 8 nature reserves on a surface of 3000 ha and houses one third of the flora and a quarter of the fauna all over Switzerland.",
        "description": "The Grande Cariçaie is the biggest lakeside wetland all over Switzerland. It develops through shallow spots in the water, reed beds, marshes, ponds and inundated woods. The area is edged mainly by molasse layers at the wooded bluff.\n\nIt is about a young habitat, which developed at the end of the 19th century after the first Jura water correction (1868 -1891) whereby the sea level dropped of about 3 meters. The name of the «Grande Cariçaie» derives from the most common plant, the tufted sedge, also known as Carex elata.\n\nMany very rare species whereof some are unique in Switzerland or even in danger of extinction all over Europe, can find the necessary habitats for the development of beautiful populations here. These rare animals and the variety of plants can be observed alongside the roads and on the various grounds of the nature reserves equipped for the public. The nature reserves Champ-Pittet and La Sauge are excellent starting points to discover this extraordinary area.",
