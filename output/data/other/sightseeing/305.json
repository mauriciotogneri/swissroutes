        "description": "The palace is actually a medieval castle that was extended in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first express mention of the castle is preserved in a document where Count Rudolf von Werdenberg-Sargans pledges the castle to Ulrich von Matsch. The then owners – and probably also the builders – were the Counts of Werdenberg-Sargans.\n\nThe keep (from the 12th century) and the constructions on the eastern side form the oldest section of the construction. The tower is built on a plot of land of approx. 12 x 13m, and has walls that are up to 4m thick in the first floor. The original entrance was built at a height of 11m on the courtyard side.\n\nThe foundations of the St. Anna chapel were probably built in the High Middle Ages. The main altar is Late Gothic. The palace was burnt down by the Swiss in the Swabian War of 1499. The turrets were built between 1529 and 1532. The western side was extended further under Count Kaspar von Hohenems (1613-1640).\n\nThe castle has been in the possession of the Princes of Liechtenstein since 1712. For a short time (1712-1732), the palace continued to function as the headquarters of the Landvogtei (bailiwick), but the majority of the building became visibly ruined. Under Prince Johann II, the palace was finally extensively restored in the period between 1905 and 1912, and was later extended to a comfortable condition under Prince Franz Joseph II. The palace has been the permanent residence of the princely family since 1938. The palace is not accessible for the general public.",
