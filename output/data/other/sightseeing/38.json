        "abstract": "Like most cities of greater than regional significance, Bern is an important junction. It boasts many well-preserved examples of bridges dating from different centuries and constructed out of various types of building material.",
        "description": "The oldest known travel and transportation routes are rivers. Bern’s River Aare was one of its most important connections to the outside world from the town’s foundation in medieval times until the 19th century, when river transport was superseded by the railway. The Aare has also contributed indirectly to travel and transport to and from Bern throughout the centuries. Numerous bridges were constructed in various types of building material according to the preferred method and style of the particular era.\n\nBern’s oldest river crossing can be found in the eastern part of the old town. The Untertorbrücke was extended several times but its original construction dates back to between 1461 and 1489. It first lost its importance as an integral part of a trans-regional route with the building of the Nydeggbrücke in 1840/44.\n\nThe concept of developing the Kirchenfeld as a residential area originated in the 1830s. A project for a high bridge over the river followed, and an iron bridge was built in the years 1881/83. The unfamiliar materials and flimsy appearance of the structure sparked fears for safety, and the pillars of today’s Kirchenfeldbrücke were later filled and clad with concrete.",
