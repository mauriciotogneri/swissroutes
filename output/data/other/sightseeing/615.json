        "description": "Today, the Foundation stages 3 art exhibitions a year, with works of art coming from private collections and the world’s major museums. The gardens are open for a stroll through the Sculpture Park, and to see the Gallo-Roman remains.\n\nThe main archaeological relics discovered during digs in Martigny are exhibited in the Gallo-Roman Museum, and some fourty vintage cars of the brands Rolls-Royce, Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz, Alfa Romeo, Isotta-Fraschini or Hispano-Suiza in the Automobile Museum.  \n\nThe Old Arsenal also presents the two exhibitions \"Leonardo da Vinci. The Inventor\" and \"Léonard Gianadda. Over 80 years of stories to share\".",
