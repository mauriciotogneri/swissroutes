        "abstract": "To the north of the grassland in Sonlerto is an extraordinary rock shelter known as «Ciossa 'd Tea». It is covered by a massive capstone, which roofs two adjoining chambers, one of which was used as a cowshed, while the other, with an attractive porch, served as a storeroom.",
        "description": "To the north of Sonlerto is Ciossa 'd Tea, a flat, walled-off meadow containing a Splüi, or rock shelter, of great aesthetic impact. Very well preserved, it was built below a large boulder, which roofs two chambers, one of which was used as a cowshed. The shed measures seventeen square metres, is coarsely paved with flagstones and contains two feeding troughs; The other chamber is fully plastered with a concrete floor and was most probably used for storing food. Even though there may be doubts about this hypothesis, the absence of a hearth clearly indicates that this chamber was never used as living quarters, especially since the building is so close to the village of Sonlerto that the villagers could easily return home in the evening. Outside the rock shelter is a mortar, which is thought to have been used for chestnuts given that the shelter is surrounded by chestnut trees.",
