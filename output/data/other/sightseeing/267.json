        "description": "The crystal cave is well suited as an object of study for natural history lessons and is often a destination for school trips and a day out for families, companies or clubs.\n\nThe Kobelwald crystal cave is located above the hamlet of Kobelwald by Oberriet in the St. Galler Rhine valley. The atmosphere of the cave, the calcite crystals, the stalactites and stalagmites, the rushing water and the acoustics and lighting are a source of great fascination for young and old. As an accessible, water-conducting cave with a large amount of crystals, it is one of a kind in Switzerland. Come and enjoy the unique atmosphere.\n\nFollowing the cave river and over a sinter step, you arrive at the first cavern a short distance from the entrance. This is where the largest calcite deposits are situated. Entire sections of the wall are covered with white or grey, often glimmering, crystals. You then cross a small lake over a footbridge, where you can marvel at how the light plays on the water’s surface. Further on, you reach the \"calcite chasm”. The large crystals here were once embedded in protective clay and have therefore been wonderfully preserved.",
