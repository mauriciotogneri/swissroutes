        "description": "Since the opening of the extension by Basle's renowned architect's Diener & Diener, Biel now has one of the finest art museums in Switzerland. The Centre PasquArt Centre institution was founded in 1980 and the new building opened its doors on 1 January 2000.\n\nOn a first visit, the architecture is also a topic of interest – although not intended to rob the art of its due applause. In place of permanent collections, the house of art excels with constantly changing and varied exhibitions – and in addition to the presentations by well-known names, regional artists find a stage to present themselves and their experimental works of art. In particular, in the «Salle Poma» on the top floor, unusual approaches find a welcome home.\n\nA photo-forum has been integrated under the same roof, which consistently exhibits works by photographers of international fame. And the film podium provides an alternative view to ordinary cinema in pleasing context.",
