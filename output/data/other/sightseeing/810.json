        "abstract": "The Dirt Castle Dirt Park at the Hammerpark Lenzburg is built in the style of a wooden castle and located directly under the A1 motorway bridge. Protected from the weather and equipped with a lighting system, it can be enjoyed all year round.",
        "description": "The dirt park offers riding fun for beginners and pros: Beginners have a table line with five jumps at their disposal, consisting of small to medium-sized tables. A separate pump track with steep wall curves and transfer possibilities is part of the facility as well. There is also a resipit (a practice jump equipped with a rubber mat in the landing area).\n\n\nTwo double lines including a huge wallride await advanced riders. The middle line starts from the 4-metre high tower, leads over 2 doubles and further over a big dirt spine or another double to the wallride. The biggest line starts from the 5.5 metre high starting tower. It leads over a step-down jump to a double with a wooden jump (contest size) and finally to the wallride. A more technical double line runs from the 3-metre high start tower via two doubles to the resipit with a wooden jump. The resipit can also be ridden by less experienced bikers. It is 6 metres wide and 9 metres long. You land on a layer of foam mats, covered with rubber mats for practising tricks.\n\nThe park also has a lighting system that makes it possible to ride in the dark, especially in the autumn and winter months. In addition to the dirt park, Hammerpark Lenzburg offers a skate facility and a bouldering block for free use - also illuminated.\n",
