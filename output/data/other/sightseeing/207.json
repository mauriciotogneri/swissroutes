        "abstract": "A jewel of the Swiss museum scene is located in an elevated position above Winterthur: one of the most distinguished private collections of the 20th century awaits you in a villa hidden away behind old trees in an idyllic garden.",
        "description": "Already in his lifetime the Winterthur art collector Oskar Reinhart turned his residential house «Am Römerholz» into a museum. He had an imposing picture gallery added on. After his death in 1965 his beneficiary, the Swiss Confederation, opened the doors to Reinhart's treasures. The Impressionist works of 19th-century French painters such as Renoir, Cézanne and Monet stand out, to name but a few.\n\nIn addition these are joined by individual exquisite paintings by the old masters such as Rubens, Goya and Bruegel. The villa and historic park with its sculptures combined with the collection constitute an impressive complete work of art. The charming café, inviting you to follow the enjoyment of art with delicacies of the table.",
