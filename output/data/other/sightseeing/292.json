        "abstract": "The Seerenbach Falls by Betlis on Walensee form a cascade of three waterfalls with a total height of 585m. In the gorge where the Seerenbah Falls imposingly crash into the depths is also the place where the Rin source meets the light of day.",
        "description": "With almost 600m of vertical height, the Seerenbach Falls form one of Europe’s tallest waterfalls. The middle stage, with its height of 305m, is also one of Switzerland’s tallest free-falling waterfalls. Directly below the point where the Seerenbach cascade comes crashing down is the place where the Rin source leaves the mountain and falls over a 45m tall rock face into the Seerenbach.\n\nThe Rin source is one of Europe’s largest subterranean river systems. Various expeditions with diving equipment have been made to research the Rin cave and have made their way more than 1000m into the inside of the mountain. A tunnel than leads outside functions as an overflow system for the subterranean river system during rainy periods and when the snow melts. Around 3000m from the cave entrance the river branches off and water disappears into the inside of the cave. Where does it go? – That will probably always be a secret.",
