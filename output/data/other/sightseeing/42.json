        "abstract": "Hiking from St. Niklaus over the Augstbordpass into the Turtmanntal valley means venturing well and truly off the beaten track. If we could go back a few centuries, we might meet bathers and pack-animal trains with Italian merchandise.",
        "description": "In days of yore, traffic levels over the Augstbordpass were dictated by the climate: as a regional link between central Canton Valais and Italy coupled with the Theodulpass, it saw a revival in colder phases and a decline in traffic in warmer phases, when pass crossings at higher altitudes were better frequented.\n\nThe discovery and operation of the «Goldbrunnji» mineral spring in the Augstbordtälli valley attracted numerous visitors to the area between the 16th and 18th centuries. Apothecary Kaspar Ambüel is quoted as saying: «Here they come with their ailments. They wash their bodies and limbs with ice-cold water and, simple-mindedly yet, drink almost until they are brimming over.»\n\nThe structure of the section between St. Niklaus and the Augstbordtal valley is especially worthy of mention. The ascent to Jungu consists primarily of a partly paved path along a slope supported by retaining walls on the valley side and bordered by wayside shrines.\n\nAn exceptional structure can be found above the tree line: the section of the path to the south and north of the Twära crest boasts paving, steps, walling and dam structures in a climate exposed to erosion and block glacier movement. Greater parts of the path were built in the 1930s for reforestry purposes and avalanche defence construction.",
