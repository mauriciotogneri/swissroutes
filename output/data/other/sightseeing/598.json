        "description": "Braunwald Municipality first became independent in 1939, before which time it had long been an Alpine level of Rüti Municipality. However, evidence dating back to the 12th century proves the existence of an Alpine settlement here at that time. In 1896/97, the building of a sanatorium for lung diseases, today’s Höhenklinik (Alpine clinic), necessitated construction of a road down to the valley. This link, built on the initiative of the road corporation, was opened at the same time as the sanatorium.\n\nHowever it soon became clear that the extremely steep terrain made the road very tough going and sometimes practically impassable in winter. These problems led to the opening of the first aerial cableway for goods transport in 1901, which in turn was replaced by a funicular in 1907. Today signposted as a hiking path, the road winds up around numerous serpentine bends and is remarkable for its first-rate quality of construction. Numerous walls, built of natural stone and stones gathered in the immediate vicinity, as well as many bends with retaining walls, provide the prerequisites for a uniform gradient on the entire ascent.",
