        "description": "Johanna Spyri's international bestseller «Heidi» has lost none of its magic to this day. For over 120 years now, Heidi has been a symbol of home, truthfulness and good deeds. Heidi is part of the Grisons in the same way as the ibex, the Rhaeto-Romanic and the true alpine adventure world. And what is more, a host of screen and TV films, books, articles and media features has made Heidi the most famous citizen of not only the Grisons but indeed the whole of Switzerland.\n\nExperience Heidi up close and personal. From Maienfeld in the Bündner Herrschaft, the Heidi Trail leads through narrow streets and vineyards up to the original Heidi Village. Here one can visit Heidi's bedroom, the rustic living room, the storage cellar and the kitchen. The adventure trail up to Heidi's Alp tells the famous story in twelve stages.",
