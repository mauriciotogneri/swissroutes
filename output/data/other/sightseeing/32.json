        "abstract": "The Col du Marchairuz belongs to the historic pass route connecting the Vallée de Joux with Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). It has been in existence since the 13th century. A particularly well-preserved section has survived to this day.",
        "description": "History of the settlement of the area shows that a route over the Col du Marchairuz was already in existence in medieval times. The Vallon des Amburnex was settled in the 13th century, and the people who lived there travelled along routes that allowed access to the villages on the northern shore of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva) as well as the settlements in the Vallée de Joux.\n\n18th century sources document that the condition of these paths was not always good: Aubonne complained repeatedly about the bad state of the «chemin des Amburnex ou du Marchairuz». Nevertheless, a section of the route has luckily survived to the present day.\n\nThe modern road over the Col de Marchairuz can be detoured at the serpentine to the west of the summit. The detour is a four-metre-wide path with a paved surface. The limestone rock can be seen at intervals. This section is only around 500 metres long and was built in the 18th century. It has many traditional elements that are considered worth preserving.",
