        "abstract": "The new Bear Park - and landmark of Berne. The heraldic animal and emblem of Berne, the bear, now thrives in a new 6000m2 large natural park on the periphery of the UNESCO Old Town. A private bear bath and many lookout points make this a delightful sight for tourists - and all at no personal price.",
        "description": "In the new and natural Bear Park, the bear couple Björk and Finn find themselves in a realm in which they can climb, fish and play; while at the same time withdraw from the public eye for a bit of peace.\n\nA visit to the Bear Park is equally as enjoyable for adults and children – and special nature trails lead visitors through the countryside down to the path along the banks of the River Aare, thus providing a great insight into the sort of natural habitat and lifestyle of bears.\n\nWith a bit of luck you can also view them swim, climb and fish in the approximately 6000 square-meter enclosure that extends from the bear pit to date, as far as the banks of the Aare. Small woods, numerous shrubs, caves and a large pool parallel to the River Aare make this a bear paradise that assimilates their natural habitat.",
