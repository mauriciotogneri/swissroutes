        "abstract": "Surrounded by Switzerland's highest mountains, the vineyards of Visperterminen flourish at altitudes of up to 1,150 metres - higher than anywhere else in Europe. Among the grape varieties cultivated here is the rare Heida, which grows well ath thes heights.",
        "description": "Between Visp and Visperterminen there are countless little terraced vineyards on a sun-drenched steep slope, which produce a special wine made from grapes that have the distinction of having grown on Europe's highest vineyard.\n\nThere is a vineyard that is located between Visp (650 m.a.s.l) and Visperterminen (1200 m.a.sl.) dispersed onto many small terraces which catch the sun optimally. It produces a special kind of wine: the Heida wine, a wine made of the very rare Heida grapes. These grapes grow very well in this clay which also contains slight amounts of limestone.\r\nBut there are other wines grown here which are just as interesting and rare, such as the Rhin, Muscat, Humagne rouge or Syrah. Many of these wines offer a bouquet of high alpine pastures, alpine flowers, and the smell of granite walls in the sunshine.\n\nVisits to the cellars ane vineyards are possible, along with wine tastings; reservations recommended.",
