        "abstract": "The Salginatobel Bridge traverses the Salgina Gorge at a height of 90 m with its 90m wide arch. With this bridge, the municipality of Schiers owns Switzerland's only world monument.",
        "description": "The Salginatobel Bridge spans the Salgina Gorge at a height of 90 metres. This crowning glory of bridge building was opened to traffic in 1930. Designed by Swiss engineer Robert Maillard, the bridge received the highest international distinction possible for a construction work in 1991 when it was declared a World Monument (other World Monuments include the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Statue of Liberty in New York).\n\nToday the Salginatobel Bridge is more famous than ever. The «Historic Salginatobel Bridge Circular Trail», which for the most part follows the old Schuders mule track, is used daily by visitors who are inspired by the bold position of this world famous structure. Large signs at the entrances to the village and sign posts within the village point the way to this special bridge experience.",
