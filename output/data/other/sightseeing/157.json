        "description": "The gardens of Vullierens Castle are reputed for their collection of irises in bloom from mid-May to mid-June. Mrs Doreen Bovet, the wife of one of the owners of Vullierens, created the iris garden fifty years ago. The flower selections constitute one of the most modern gardens in Europe. New varieties are added every year.\n\nYou can also admire a huge selection of seasonal flowers and plants. For example, from May to July, there are irises, roses, lavender, peonies, hemerocallis, hardy perennials, wild flowers, and butterfly plants. In September, fuchsias, climbing irises, asters (or Queen Daisy), decorating plants, roses, and sedum. As their flowering depends on the weather, obtaining information on opening hours is recommended.\n\nThe Castle of Vulllierens, as it stands today, dates of the beginning of the 18th century. It is still inhabited by one of the descendants of the lords of the manor. Its exterior can be glimpsed from the lower village, by strolling through the gardens or on the bridle path featuring a collection of contemporary sculptures.",
