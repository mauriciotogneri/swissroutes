        "description": "You will be charmed by the spectacular natural beauty Joux Valley has to offer and which is immediately visible when taking off from Le Pont and following the small path leading to Dent de Vaulion. Just before you reach the summit, you will find a conveniently located pub in the Alpine meadows where you can enjoy a delicious fondue.\n\nThe final ascent unveils bit by bit a sensational panorama: you will see all of western Switzerland at your feet. If the sky is clear, you will be able to admire three lakes. Lake Geneva, the Alps of the Lake Geneva Region, (and, further away, the French Alps with Mont-Blanc), the Jura, Lake Neuchâtel and, closest, an unrestricted view of Lake Joux. This is the only vantage point from where the three lakes are visible together.",
