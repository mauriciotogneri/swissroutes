        "abstract": "The name says it all: the trail, high above Lake Thun, is challenging and steep. Technical passages, high-speed sections and jumps, mostly in the forest, require skill, and once you’re back in the valley your heart will beat faster for more reasons than one.",
        "description": "A funicular takes the riders from Beatenbucht to Beatenberg mountain. Here, on this sunny spot high above Lake Thun, is the start of the trail. The first thing you do before you plunge down is to stop and enjoy the views of Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau, the three world-famous mountains, and sparkling Lake Thun below. From here at 1120 m, the trail is 3.5 km long and descends around 560 altitude meters. \n\nThe technically challenging, action-packed downhill track was built for advanced mountain bikers. The black trail is demanding and steep. It leads mainly through the forest and there are lots of technical passages and high-speed sections along the way. They alternate with gaps and drops, which are positively an encouragement to jump. \n\nAnd the name speaks for itself: about an hour later and definitely with a faster heartbeat, you arrive at charming, relaxing Beatenbucht on Lake Thun. \n\n\nDifficulty: black trail (difficult) \nLength: 3.5 km",
