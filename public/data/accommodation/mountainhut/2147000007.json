{"id":2147000007,"properties":{"title":"Capanna da l'Albigna CAS","abstract":null,"description":"For climbers the gondola of the hydroelectric power station makes the family-friendly Albignahut above the Albigna reservoir easily accessible. It is appropriate and equipped for workshops and small seminars. The region in Bergell is a climbing Eldorado (just think of «Fiamma»). Close to the cabin are granite spires and rocks with roughly 100 itineraries, some suitable for beginners and kids. The Albigna hut CAS is a stopover for passages and tours into the surrounding valleys including the tour across the Passo Casnil to the Capanna del Forno CAS.\nOperation of the cable car Pranzaira - Albigna: mid-June to mid-October, 07.00 to 11.30, 13.15 to 16.45. In winter the cableway remains closed. The winter access from Pranzaira without cable car is not recommended. The hut is reached in winter mainly in combination with tours in the Forno area.","r_number":2147000007,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 822 14 05","email":"capanna@albigna.ch","url1_link":"http://www.albigna.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528904630_357035553.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522853689_375896734.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522846838_1763470282.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528904630_1306290728.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528904630_1783600798.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522846849_2069156805.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.33007061877112,9.655306771416278]}}
