{"id":2147000101,"properties":{"title":"Fridolinshütten SAC","abstract":null,"description":"In summer and winter this is a popular starting point in the southernmost part of the canton of Glaris for the challenging ascent of Tödi. The cabin, primarily visited by true mountaineers, has even more to offer: beautiful high mountain tours to other SAC cabins. Swimming is possible in the small mountain lake close to the cabin. Slightly higher up, the historical Grünhornhütte is the oldest SAC cabin and has been transformed into a museum. It is no longer available for accommodation.","r_number":2147000101,"city":"Grison Alps, Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","place":"Grison Alps, Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","tel":"+41 55 643 34 34","email":"fridolinshuette-sac@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"http://www.fridolinshuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1685527369_73526752.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228871_1751799898.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228871_637432307.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522854066_1325069084.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228871_597700579.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228871_853552732.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522848423_1121811977.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522848423_446998682.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.821274000572494,8.950063359838234]}}
