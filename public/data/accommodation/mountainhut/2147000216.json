{"id":2147000216,"properties":{"title":"Ramozhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"Not far away from Arosa, Alp Ramoz is a very quiet site. A narrow path leads up the long Welschtobel to the cabin in an area where the common language is Rhaeto-Romanic. The well-equipped cabin for self-caterers has its original charm making it an insider’s tip for silence seekers and small groups. Summit ascents and col crossings in summer, ski mountaineering and snowshoe tours in winter are the main attractions.","r_number":2147000216,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 356 55 02","email":"ramozhuette@sacarosa.ch","url1_link":"http://www.sacarosa.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1626774146_247930458.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1626774134_1457459304.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528815015_2012911613.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528815015_382637121.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1625041310_1026976262.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1626774293_139784800.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521371430_278804147.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.73089326990369,9.643715477314908]}}
