{"id":2147000255,"properties":{"title":"Spannorthütte SAC","abstract":"Sac de couchage obligatoire (possibilité de louer ou acheter)","description":"The cabin is located on an impressive site at the foot of Schlossberg, close to the climbing summits Gross and Chli Spannort, in the midst of a wild, untouched environment. It lies high above Engelberg, the tourist resort in the canton of Obwalden, but on Uri soil, as the region of Surenenpass belongs to the canton of Uri. The characteristic cabin nestled against the rocks was recently enlarged by a new addition under the terrace. The crossing of Schlossberglücke to Kröntenhütte is fairly popular.","r_number":2147000255,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 41 637 34 80","email":"info@spannorthuette.ch","url1_link":"https://www.spannorthuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1531488865_1562178568.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_573140617.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_1799959837.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1532505400_1314518296.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_1658207493.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1532508890_857172178.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_1738176599.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_1180243823.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881315_840309966.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881316_1061341129.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530881309_959080645.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.79969334282622,8.510405031874765]}}
