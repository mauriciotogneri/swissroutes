In 2017 the cabin was renovated and enlarged by an annex. The sunny location and the view from Piz Palü to Mönch with the Alvier and Churfirsten ranges in the foreground make it a popular target among mountain hikers. Climbers find attractive routes of all difficulty grades on Altmann, Fählentürm or Kreuzberge and in the climbing park close to the cabin. Other attractions include the large ibex colony on Altmann and the many caves (one of them an ice cave) in the karst.","r_number":2147000300,"city":"Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","place":"Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","tel":"+41 71 565 36 21","email":"reservation@sac-toggenburg.ch","url1_link":"http://www.sac-toggenburg.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1543489789_1882647681.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1541088053_1305748265.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1543489789_1349662371.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[47.233154980957465,9.376071891410026]}}
