{"id":2147000143,"properties":{"title":"Kröntenhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"Where the southbound intercity trains disappear in the Gotthard tunnel, Erstfeldertal branches off to the right. At the very back of this valley, at the foot of Krönten and Spannort, the mountain guest house is located in the midst of an alpine high moor area. The family-friendly cabin is convenient for high alpine tours and boasts nearby climbing parks, boulders, mountain lakes and its own hydroelectric power station. The newly enlarged SAC cabin is very well suited for groups, courses and seminars.","r_number":2147000143,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 41 880 01 22","email":"kroentenhuette@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"http://www.kroentenhuette.com","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504534994_1752250380.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504535013_1748465496.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504534968_523009815.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522854855_1982838198.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520522660_919232780.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520522776_1298922178.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520522673_1676482331.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520522790_1251921886.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520522762_1730745941.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504535043_879009421.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504535029_1201546398.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.8000635852545,8.57543048574548]}}
