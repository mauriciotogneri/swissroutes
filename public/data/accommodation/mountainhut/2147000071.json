{"id":2147000071,"properties":{"title":"Dammahütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"Located on a mountain hiking trail in the remotest part of Göschenertal, at the foot of Dammastock, the highest peak of the canton of Uri. The house was first erected in Berne for the National Exhibition of 1914. A year later it was dismantled and transported to today’s location. The cabin maintains its rustic charm: e.g. there are still woollen blankets in the dormitory and no running water in the kitchen. As in the old days water must be carried into the cabin in buckets and boiled before use.","r_number":2147000071,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 41 885 17 81","email":"info@dammahuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.dammahuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1627041938_2066649104.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1627041952_1071988448.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1559808161_408298207.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1565004902_2049912090.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605077589_1289344507.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1634815214_243511704.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1634816374_1681229913.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1627041973_667866890.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.64481914401739,8.457733843319366]}}
