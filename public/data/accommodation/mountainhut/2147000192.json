{"id":2147000192,"properties":{"title":"Oberaarjochhütte SAC","abstract":"L.de la fonte des neiges, risque de chute de pierres amplifié","description":"A secluded, spectacular mountain retreat that has retained its traditional charm. Clinging to the rock, it hangs over space. The ascent via ladders, a rock band and finally through the covered gallery is quite extraordinary. Approached from Grimselpass, it is a great launch site for adventures further into the Finsteraarhorn and Aletsch areas. In spring there are often good conditions on the surrounding snow-covered glacier, as well as stable snowpack.","r_number":2147000192,"city":"Bernese Alps, Valais","place":"Bernese Alps, Valais","tel":"+41 33 973 13 82","email":"info@oberaarjochhuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.oberaarjochhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297489_1447602791.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297246_595006464.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523950663_1442081868.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297710_1776748140.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523950658_667598068.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523950660_1493447927.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297467_403975838.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297597_237833370.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.52601275933851,8.173186502801965]}}
