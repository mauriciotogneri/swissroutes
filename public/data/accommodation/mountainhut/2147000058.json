{"id":2147000058,"properties":{"title":"Capanna Cava","description":"Capanna Cava, well hidden, is located in a side valley between Biasca and the border ridge Riviera-Calanca. The immediate environs are very gentle, even offering a little lake close to the cabin. The pastures of Alpe di Cava, however, are surrounded by massive rocky peaks, above all Torent Alto. The cabin is a cosy base for long and demanding hikes (e.g. over to Val d'Osogna or Calanca) and challenging mountain hiking tours in rugged terrain.","r_number":2147000058,"city":"Ticino","place":"Ticino","tel":"+41 91 870 14 44","email":null,"url1_link":"https://www.utoe-biasca.ch/capanna-cava","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513776913_66886530.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522342133_700573614.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.35744821975538,9.030329636603906]}}
