In the beginning the cabin was not much more than a “hut” without a roof; the mountaineers used to fix a canvas cover to the rafters and rolled it up again when they went on towards Tödi. Today the building is a «high alpine historic monument» and small museum. Information boards explain the historical background and it is forbidden to use it for accommodation.","r_number":2147000126,"city":"Grison Alps, Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","place":"Grison Alps, Glarus – St. Gallen – Appenzell","tel":null,"email":null,"url1_link":"http://www.sac-toedi.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699280_503341225.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699279_816518065.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699279_1176543995.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699279_69760902.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699279_129068684.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530699279_2016170891.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.81050214162548,8.941374353894444]}}
