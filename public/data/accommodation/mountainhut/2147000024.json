{"id":2147000024,"properties":{"title":"Balmhornhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"The cosy, authentic summer cabin takes you back in time. Situated almost vertically above Gasteretal near Kandersteg on a shoulder at the foot of Balmhorn, surrounded by green mountain pastures, the gem of a cabin stands out due to the location on a promontory. Mountain hikers love to ascend Gasterespitz on Wildelsigegrat with its overwhelming panorama across the Kanderfirn and further on to Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau.","r_number":2147000024,"city":"Bernese Alps","place":"Bernese Alps","tel":"+41 33 675 13 40","email":"balmhornhuette@sac-altels.ch","url1_link":"http://www.balmhornhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530187848_1217311200.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528876762_1665695799.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522137075_1048537806.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528876762_1089304497.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528876763_1010698858.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522137082_2107462335.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522137087_1190858080.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.45128542486783,7.689567354207958]}}
