The small and simple shelter is for self-caterers only; in high summer and autumn even water must be carried up. The area with its view to the glaciated Damma range and to Sustenhorn is considered a natural power place.","r_number":2147000230,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":null,"email":"salbit@sac-mythen.ch","url1_link":"https://sac-mythen.ch/unsere-huetten","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1518881141_1042389683.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.67614749717253,8.523676878908017]}}
