{"id":2147000267,"properties":{"title":"Terrihütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"A popular, spacious cabin with three lounges and a dozen rooms. The view of Tödi on the other side of Surselva is extraordinary. The cabin is the starting point for hikes from cabin to cabin and fairly easy summit ascents, but the main destination is the hike from Val Lumnezia or Sumvitg across the high plateau of Greina to Val Blenio in the canton of Tessin. Greinapass is one of the oldest north-south cols across the Alps which was already used in the Middle Ages by sumpters.","r_number":2147000267,"city":"Ticino, Grison Alps","place":"Ticino, Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 943 12 05","email":"terrihuette@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"http://www.terrihuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_1493209107.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_983763852.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_771712688.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_773236978.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1557231769_2126694395.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1557157042_2113204774.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_1097292154.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528819602_223932911.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.63456190252647,9.004924100230156]}}
