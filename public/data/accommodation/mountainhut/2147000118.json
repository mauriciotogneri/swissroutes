This SAC cabin, formerly known as the Gleckstein Hotel, is on the way to the Grindelwald Wetterhorn. Today it is suited for seminars and is visited by mountaineers for summit ascents and glacier tours, as well as by mountain hikers who want to experience the glacier world or the ruins of the legendary Wetterhorn cable car. On the way up they might encounter «Tucki», the leader of the bouquetin colony living in the environs.","r_number":2147000118,"city":"Bernese Alps","place":"Bernese Alps","tel":"+41 33 853 11 40","email":"welcome@gleckstein.ch","url1_link":"http://www.gleckstein.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244386_762856509.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244386_1828677000.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244386_1727420839.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244386_402350877.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522854394_375744105.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244678_958897013.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244678_916599149.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244678_709677180.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244918_10501919.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504510957_1418090881.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520244918_793770704.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.62507610128587,8.096710529066677]}}
