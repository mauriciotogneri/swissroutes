{"id":2147000235,"properties":{"title":"Capanna Sasc Fur√§ CAS","abstract":null,"description":"The cabin is located on a ledge at the foot of Pizzo Badile above Val Bondasca (Bregaglia). The picturesque cabin surrounded by a light larch forest is the base camp for ambitious climbing tours such as the north ridge and Via Cassin in the north face of Pizzo Badile. The cabin is a popular stopover for challenging hikes such as the multi-day Sentiero Alpino Bregaglia from cabin to cabin, but mountain connoisseurs also love it. A small stone building nearby can be reserved by families.","r_number":2147000235,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 822 12 52","email":"info@sascfura.ch","url1_link":"http://www.sascfura.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1716456556_197844201.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530634481_469592312.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1716457771_537209041.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530634483_254588212.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1716456084_1668480784.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520875573_1421374938.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1716456777_927968075.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1716456232_1731306506.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.31532066394665,9.58243071309735]}}
