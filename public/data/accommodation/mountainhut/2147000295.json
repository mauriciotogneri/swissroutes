The attractions are the 100 metres high suspension bridge across Triftsee, various alpine tours and classic mountain hikes in the environs. The nearby climbing park and spectacular flying fox (with assistance only) make the cabin an ideal place for training courses, children's’ climbing workshops and climbing camps in general.","r_number":2147000295,"city":"Bernese Alps","place":"Bernese Alps","tel":"+41 33 975 11 10","email":"huettenwart@windegghuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.windegghuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1626782187_1326883261.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1552559837_549786337.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1586946827_741166456.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529414766_113841140.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1552559809_833405637.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1626782091_1915744000.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1552559809_539845403.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522835049_973717462.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1552559808_1548449467.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1552560100_1586372036.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.69494830842294,8.347897845123041]}}
