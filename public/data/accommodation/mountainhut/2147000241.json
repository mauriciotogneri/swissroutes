{"id":2147000241,"properties":{"title":"Schönbielhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"The Matterhorn north face is the dominating element on the way to the cabin, in summer as well as winter. Then the view opens to the equally beautiful white Dent d'Hérens, which was probably named due to a mix-up with Dent Blanche. Surrounded by majestic four-thousanders, the cabin is the starting point of high alpine tours such as the Valais Haute Route. But the cabin in the Zmutt valley is a hiking destination from Zermatt in its own right.","r_number":2147000241,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 967 13 54","email":"bielti.zermatt@gmx.ch","url1_link":"http://www.section-monte-rosa.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528799676_1429908326.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548335576_1174259421.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528799676_591263336.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528799676_1517586475.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548335577_1057012850.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548335576_1517819350.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548335576_1036309818.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548335577_1576931622.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528799676_2111460488.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528799678_1127007747.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.00198405758488,7.6290323610628565]}}
