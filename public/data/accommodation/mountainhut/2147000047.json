{"id":2147000047,"properties":{"title":"Capanna Brogoldone","description":"Capanna Brogoldone, located high above Bellinzona on a wide ridge between Riviera and Mesolcina, is a very cosy cabin. Its location above the timberline means the access trail is in the shadow of a forest and the cabin is bathed in sunshine. It is a hiking target in its own right and a popular base for the ascension of Pizzo di Claro on one of the many routes.","r_number":2147000047,"city":"Ticino, Grison Alps","place":"Ticino, Grison Alps","tel":"+41 91 829 43 50","email":null,"url1_link":"http://www.capanneti.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1537868814_2105308361.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.26290200904518,9.063316193841777]}}
