The surrounding summits of the Medel and Greina ranges are additional targets for Scaletta visitors. If you take the bus to Pian Geirett, the cabin is the most accessible of the Greina cabins. Close to the cabin, Arco della Greina, a unique natural arch, is worth visiting.","r_number":2147000236,"city":"Ticino, Grison Alps","place":"Ticino, Grison Alps","tel":"+41 91 872 26 28","email":"scaletta@satlucomagno.ch","url1_link":"https://www.satlucomagno.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513784474_241879373.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.60762902885728,8.940434799818402]}}
