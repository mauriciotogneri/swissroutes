The orange coloured shelter on a small moraine mound close to the glacier resembles a space capsule and is mounted on a concrete foundation for stability. The interior is simple, functional, just like in a mobile home (some kitchenware, but no cooking facilities).","r_number":2147000080,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":null,"email":null,"url1_link":"https://www.cas-gruyere.ch/fr/cabanes/bivouac-du-dolent/","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530545098_354677031.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[45.927235963700596,7.068935716549685]}}
