The charming, small Elahut is the base for ascents to the two mighty dolomite summits Piz Ela and Tinzenhorn, as well as for hikes across the cols between the two valleys. The mountain hike trails to Alp Flix or Preda are insider tips. Close to the «new» cabin there is the old Ela cabin, which small groups like to use.","r_number":2147000086,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":null,"email":"ela@sac-davos.ch","url1_link":"http://www.sac-davos.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898364_177799598.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898364_1730102590.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1579689798_485453965.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898364_2033787222.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898364_564781356.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.618749078759926,9.691850037428546]}}
