{"id":2147000153,"properties":{"title":"Leutschachhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"Parts of the cabin’s lobby have been preserved in the style of its origins, the legendary 1939 National Exhibition in Zurich called “Landi”, where the cabin had been exhibited as the «SAC club cabin». A year later it was transported to the present location, a high valley west of Amsteg. A climbing park of a special kind is situated on the shores of Obersee: climbers begin their routes right from a raft (the family climbing park can be accessed avoiding the raft). Moreover, along the lake there is a Kneipp trail. The access trail via Sunniggrat with its panorama view is very attractive.","r_number":2147000153,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 41 883 15 17","email":"furrer_andreaaa@gmx.ch","url1_link":"http://www.leutschachhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522237093_1934364780.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1607343541_990488215.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1607262638_843992782.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1607343541_1352309119.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522237093_1656417110.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522237093_538967893.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522237093_1976650032.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522237093_947077894.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.783602365466464,8.601145646329524]}}
