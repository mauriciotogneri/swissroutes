{"id":2147000070,"properties":{"title":"Cufercalh√ºtte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"While down in the Rheinwald valley the traffic is buzzing on A13, the cabin Cufercal several hundred metres above offers the quiet and romance of a traditional cabin. The cabin for mountain hikers and mountain bikers is the only SAC cabin in the Beverin nature park, where in 1954 the bouquetin (ibex) was reintroduced. A major attraction are the half dozen mountain lakes in the environs. The area is suited for easy ski mountaineering and snowshoe tours.","r_number":2147000070,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 79 954 65 71","email":"info@cufercalhuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.cufercalhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824737_1281705251.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1576158656_177497038.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574267739_1642191025.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824737_1931334604.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824737_1681408541.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824737_2117621219.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520602124_803151725.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824740_1430592161.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528824737_1092438886.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.593328791688315,9.35901566696851]}}
