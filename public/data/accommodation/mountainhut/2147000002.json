{"id":2147000002,"properties":{"title":"Capanna Adula CAS","abstract":null,"description":"This is a simple, rustic, family-friendly SAC cabin with a splendid view, located at the foot of Adula (or Rheinwaldhorn), the highest peak of the Ticino. It can be accessed from various directions: e.g. via the artificial Luzzone lake or through the idyllic Val di Carassino (by mountain bike, too). There is a more direct, steep and demanding trail from Dangio in Valle di Blenio. Climbers like to ascend summits in the Adula range, while the challenging «Via alta della Val Carassino» is popular among hikers. There are two cabins, in Ticino they are referred to as «Adula CAS» (the lower one) and «Adula UTOE» (the upper one).","r_number":2147000002,"city":"Ticino","place":"Ticino","tel":"+41 91 872 15 32","email":"adula@casticino.ch","url1_link":"http://www.capannaadula.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502100126_1704832707.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502105960_1913145044.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529671353_149764725.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520585610_1637645740.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502099716_420672028.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502099948_1689253577.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.49909694316225,8.995795438843608]}}
