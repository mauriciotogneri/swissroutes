The small, rustic shelter without any cooking facilities lies on the way of the first ascent to this characteristic summit in the centre of the Unseco world heritage site. The long ascent to the cabin is across the Grosser Aletschgletscher and today is mostly across the pathless median moraine of Mittelaletschgletscher. In winter/spring the cabin is popular among experienced ski mountaineers.","r_number":2147000173,"city":"Bernese Alps, Valais","place":"Bernese Alps, Valais","tel":null,"email":null,"url1_link":"http://www.cas-diablerets.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1549529464_1263971821.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.46489808354161,8.023814787566804]}}
