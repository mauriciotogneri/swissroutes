{"id":2147000065,"properties":{"title":"Chamanna Coaz CAS","abstract":null,"description":"Everything about the Coazhut is round: the outer walls, the lounge, the dormitory with its trapeziform berths. It is surrounded by the mountains of the Bernina range. Summit ascents and rock climbing in one of the climbing parks are the summer attractions. Hikers and families like the rather comfortable access trail from Fuorcla Surlej to the high alpine promontory close to the glacier with its splendid view. Ski mountaineering and formation courses are the main activities in winter.","r_number":2147000065,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 842 62 78","email":"info@coaz.ch","url1_link":"http://www.coaz.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1591274406_469093105.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890189_1787276351.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890188_2006157674.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890188_1389724662.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528894352_962894612.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528894354_1442886136.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890189_1417681417.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890189_1439014419.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890188_33092936.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890188_1721394922.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554890187_2011621720.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.383683888701334,9.83546036461633]}}
