{"id":2147000177,"properties":{"title":"Cabane de Moiry CAS","abstract":null,"description":"Mountaineers as well as experienced hikers love the cabin in the rearmost part of Grimentz valley beyond the Moiry reservoir. To the traditional stone building, whose interior was renovated, a modern annex with a copper fa√ßade has been added. The view through the panorama windows of the new lounge onto the crevassed Glacier de Moiry, which extends up to Grand Cornier, is awesome. The access from the rear end of Lac de Moiry is only a short hike.","r_number":2147000177,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 475 45 34","email":"moiry@cas-montreux.ch","url1_link":"http://www.cabane-moiry.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1567501985_885221718.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990186_198793382.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990186_1024625301.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990186_707080363.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1567501985_1876575435.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990186_148010587.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990190_291064669.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990191_497539793.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990190_1778223433.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528990191_1210262725.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1567501985_1859714668.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1567501986_1121984253.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1593434472_1304826661.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.090820875610106,7.595467609037799]}}
