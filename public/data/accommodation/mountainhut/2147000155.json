Newly erected in a traditional style, the Linard hut in the «Glims» hollow between Lavin (in the Lower Engadine) and the summit of Piz Linard, roughly 800 metres above the east portal of Vereina Tunnel. A colony of bouquetins often roam the environs of the cabin. In summer it offers summit ascents on partly crumbling rock with wide ranging views, alpine hikes via Lai Glims into Val Sagliains or the Vereina round trip towards Klosters.","r_number":2147000155,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 79 629 61 91","email":"linard@alpinist.ch","url1_link":"http://www.linardhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898002_197814884.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898002_1858139343.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898002_126591107.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898002_760748217.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528898002_661251081.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.77943071392273,10.082868998561676]}}
