{"id":2147000029,"properties":{"title":"Berglihütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"It was originally built as a base for ascents of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. One of the very first SAC cabins; with its simple equipment and the separate lavatory hut, it is living testimony of the early days of alpine tourism. That is exactly what makes this simple, spectacularly located hut attractive. It is a site of heritage; a little gem. Access is granted via the Ewigschneefeld glacier from the Jungfraujoch.","r_number":2147000029,"city":"Bernese Alps, Valais","place":"Bernese Alps, Valais","tel":null,"email":"chr.nebiker@alpinice.ch","url1_link":"https://www.konkordiahuette.ch/index.php/de/?view=article&id=22&catid=10","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574767653_149384223.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574768167_446345277.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528210174_155540249.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574768167_159131045.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1557247511_28652517.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574768167_1070641686.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574768329_1206045068.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1518189684_1640194587.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574768167_2011708698.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.566748248488516,8.020481268481873]}}
