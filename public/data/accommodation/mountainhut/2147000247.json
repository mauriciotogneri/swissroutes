The environs offer several climbing parks with climbs up to 6th grade, some of them especially equipped for children. The flying fox and Sewensee with a small rowboat are additional attractions. Alpine hikers and climbers find satisfying possibilities as well. The cabin is suited for training courses.","r_number":2147000247,"city":"Central Switzerland","place":"Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 41 885 18 72","email":"info@sewenhuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.sewenhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529415588_1462736664.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529414835_1295481924.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529414836_384984255.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520606375_1865731217.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520606470_766556834.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523957544_594488791.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523957541_286767418.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520606506_888151706.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520606489_267684506.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.74658712461951,8.52102376749891]}}
