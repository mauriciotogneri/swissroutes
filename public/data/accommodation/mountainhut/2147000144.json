{"id":2147000144,"properties":{"title":"Lagginbiwak SAC","abstract":"seulement bougies","description":"Located on the east face of Fletschhorn and Lagginhorn, the small cabin is rarely visited and can accommodate 10 self-catering mountaineers. It has a long history: decided upon in 1876/77, the first shelter in Laggintal was not built until 80 years later. It was a gift by the then existing Schweizer Frauen Alpenclub (Swiss Women’s Alpine Club). Today’s cabin with a wooden interior can be reached by a mountain trail from Simplon-Dorf. The tours include high alpine ascents and alpine cols in trackless terrain.","r_number":2147000144,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 79 758 63 34","email":"zumstein.irma@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.section-monte-rosa.ch/de/unsere-hutten/lagginbiwak","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504766991_1684337261.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529487868_1772969984.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520578861_133717200.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529488354_1982149102.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529488195_466997191.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529488179_144585169.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.16450326002533,8.045320078237785]}}
