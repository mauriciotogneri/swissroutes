Val d’Hérens is situated between the Arolla and Ferpècle valleys on the Valais High Route. The house with the original form and dormitories on four levels is only accessible by climbing up ladders. Even in summer access requires crossing a glacier making for a high alpine challenge. The cabin is characterized by the high alpine scenery of Dent Blanche, Matterhorn and Dent d'Hérens.","r_number":2147000031,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 283 19 29","email":"bertol@cas-neuchatel.ch","url1_link":"http://www.bertol.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528984612_180213886.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528984612_976385735.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528984612_633105779.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528984612_1775905142.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522153339_1433669282.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.006067724623804,7.527710007749306]}}
