The cabin is on the “stairway to heaven”, as some call Biancograt, on the way up to Piz Bernina, the “King of the East Alps”. The spacious cabin for high mountaineers is also a popular destination among experienced hikers, who may have ridden their mountain bikes or in a horse-drawn carriage through Val Roseg and then hiked up to the cabin with its characteristic cubical annex. The view of the ridge and the alpine summits alone make a trip to the cabin an unforgettable adventure.","r_number":2147000279,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 842 63 91","email":"tschierva-sac@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"http://www.tschierva.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528900860_836283574.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528900860_33368928.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1523965351_1744599023.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528900860_141302408.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.40388163544959,9.880065518983711]}}
