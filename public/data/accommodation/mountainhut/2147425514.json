It is located at the foot of the Latelhorn, to the north-east of the Antrona Pass about two hundred meters above the top of the pass. The bivouac is the ideal starting point for the climb over the Cresta di Saas, a long ridge traverse on the border ridge Italy/Switzerland. By the way, this is the old bivouac box from Mischabeljoch, which has been given a new purpose here.","r_number":2147425514,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":null,"email":null,"url1_link":"https://sac-saas.ch/cresta_biwak/","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529313832_872229706.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529313832_1175646123.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529313739_1602586485.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529312786_794694825.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1574948010_2101000175.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1594277900_1591344360.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1588326793_1640335069.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.04476909558431,8.030220023170205]}}
