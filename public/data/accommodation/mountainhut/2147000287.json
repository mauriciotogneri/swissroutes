Many visitors reach the cabin between Pigne d'Arolla and Mont Collon on skis across the high alpine glacier world starting from other SAC cabins. To the south one looks across the vast icy expanse towards the Italian border, while behind the cabin on the direct ascent from Arolla across Glacier de Pièce the Bernese Alps can be seen far away in the north.","r_number":2147000287,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 283 13 22","email":"info@cabane-des-vignettes.ch","url1_link":"http://www.cabane-des-vignettes.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1621950797_181214371.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1533796778_909079278.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530113962_494985546.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1540453419_714037266.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1550563064_231477353.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[45.989815214981355,7.475675329502135]}}
