Here the landscapes will envelope you and yet this is a hike that is family friendly. The hut is located at the foot of the Cima della Negra and is the access point to the Bresciana Glacier, which reaches the summit at 3402m. The Adula or Rheinwaldhorn is the highest peak in Ticino. The UTOE Bellinzona (Unione Ticinese Operai Escursionisti) built this hut in 1923.","r_number":2147000003,"city":"Ticino, Grison Alps","place":"Ticino, Grison Alps","tel":"+41 77 459 96 11","email":"adula@utoe.ch","url1_link":"http://www.adula-utoe.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1678783329_1294660417.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1537348566_1256464612.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1537348676_1952484707.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1537348652_1631321096.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1537348767_811779812.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.495424517248836,9.007675772975237]}}
