The simple, rustic and cosy cabin is a popular stopover on the winter Haute Route. In summer there are climbing routes to ascend the Combin summits. In winter steep couloirs await very experienced skiers. Close to the cabin there is a climbing park with various sectors. Mountain hikers are enthused by the panorama high route from the cabin northwards.","r_number":2147000282,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 787 11 22","email":"info@valsorey.ch","url1_link":"http://www.valsorey.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530196289_477749387.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530196391_1407942552.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1581692231_1370177855.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530196289_1789477864.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530196289_1663890220.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1530196289_527095101.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[45.93032825168123,7.271695385446782]}}
