{"id":2147000113,"properties":{"title":"Geltenhütte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"Starting from the charming Lauenensee, past deep gorges and the thundering Geltenschuss and finally through a passage behind a small waterfall: the access trail to the hiking and mountaineering cabin at the foot of Wildhorn is a lasting mountain experience in its own right. The house with a large lobby and separate dormitories lends itself to club and school excursions as well as family tours. The mountain hike to Wildhornhütte and Iffigenalp is very popular. In spring there are manifold possibilities for ski mountaineering and snowshoe tours.","r_number":2147000113,"city":"Bernese Alps, Valais","place":"Bernese Alps, Valais","tel":"+41 33 765 32 20","email":"info@gelten.ch","url1_link":"http://www.gelten.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297904_1062110525.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297905_234262829.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297904_1549673412.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1554297904_1646170631.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1549968867_1689939513.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520000247_1768327209.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504100955_1436831937.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1504101045_312533854.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520000173_182301977.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522737380_1887801302.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522737724_166690181.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520000596_997581789.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.369568850180386,7.339092041053738]}}
