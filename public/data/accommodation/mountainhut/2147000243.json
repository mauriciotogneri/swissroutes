{"id":2147000243,"properties":{"title":"Schreckhornh√ºtte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"It is only through a narrow gap of the valley at the right of Eiger that the outside world such as Mittelland and far away the Jura range can be seen. Otherwise nothing but the high mountains of Bernese Oberland and mighty glaciers at close range which surround the cabin. The summer mountain guesthouse behind Unterer Grindelwaldgletscher is the starting point of various routes to Schreckhorn and of mixed routes and high alpine col crossings. Due to landslides the access is often difficult or outright impossible.","r_number":2147000243,"city":"Bernese Alps","place":"Bernese Alps","tel":"+41 33 855 10 25","email":"schreckhornhuette@bluewin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.schreckhornhuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1527779481_912270619.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1527779481_439390555.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1527779481_2071012654.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522843210_1551402118.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522843211_2101348974.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.58170388495664,8.098792396701008]}}
