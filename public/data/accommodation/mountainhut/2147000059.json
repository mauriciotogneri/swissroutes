It can also serve as a base for a multi-day sojourn away from the roads and the hubbub of the cities as well as for a training week. The main goal is Oberalpstock, possibly the summit with the best view in the area. Granite climbers love the south ridge and the walls of Piz Cavadiras and Brichlig. The «Labyrinth» close to the cabin is a natural power place.","r_number":2147000059,"city":"Grison Alps, Central Switzerland","place":"Grison Alps, Central Switzerland","tel":"+41 81 947 57 47","email":"info@cavardiras.ch","url1_link":"http://www.cavardiras.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1576163031_1271716383.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520595022_363714661.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548081813_322169128.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1520595207_464946560.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521471419_1838274457.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521471377_88185953.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521471389_1381777672.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521471446_1834229458.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521474220_94362848.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1521471466_1193513432.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1571675674_2069468853.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.742467829354055,8.814231303181124]}}
