{"id":2147000069,"properties":{"title":"Capanna Cristallina CAS","abstract":null,"description":"Newly built, large SAC mountain guesthouse on the much-frequented passage from Val Bavona to Val Bedretto. Elongated, bright, spacious, comfortable building. From the sunlit terrace one enjoys a wide- ranging panorama from the Robièi area to Basodinogletscher and on the other side from Madone to Tödi and Piz Terri. It is often used as a stopover on col hikes through the canton of Tessin, but it is also popular as a starting point for high alpine and ski mountaineering tours.","r_number":2147000069,"city":"Ticino","place":"Ticino","tel":"+41 91 869 23 30","email":"cristallina@casticino.ch","url1_link":"http://capannacristallina.casticino.ch/","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1577089867_823888342.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502703467_1286437212.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502704562_722124340.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502703560_874365555.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502704430_1326934187.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1502703955_69314281.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1519915528_942723255.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1519915972_52467241.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1519915555_932269201.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.471811522574164,8.52648819648213]}}
