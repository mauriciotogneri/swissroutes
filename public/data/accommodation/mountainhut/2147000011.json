It is a simple, rustic stone building typical for Ticino, surrounded by sparse larch forests. It is the starting point for summit ascensions, various hikes between the valleys and to two scenic mountain lakes. The access is sometimes on historical trails chopped out of the rock.","r_number":2147000011,"city":"Ticino","place":"Ticino","tel":"+41 91 753 25 15","email":"info@capannaalzasca.ch","url1_link":"http://www.capannaalzasca.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1528299352_1586595453.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1526475965_1900096051.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529671626_1889044490.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1578496249_933056247.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.27128871345839,8.5892915774627]}}
