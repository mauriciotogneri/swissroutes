Starting in the forests around Maloja, visitors turn south across fields of alpine roses above the charming LÃ¤gh da Cavloc to the glacier foreland and up a steep access to the Fornohut: an interesting trail with a view of the elongated Fornogletscher.","r_number":2147000100,"city":"Grison Alps","place":"Grison Alps","tel":"+41 81 824 31 82","email":"info@fornohuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.fornohuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228171_314449685.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228171_1942707826.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1647954279_171926267.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228171_2054353351.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228171_1167550387.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522228171_555413871.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522841306_34709304.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.33183173573473,9.709488348635439]}}
