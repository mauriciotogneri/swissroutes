{"id":2147000291,"properties":{"title":"Weissmiesh√ºtte SAC","abstract":null,"description":"The cabin offers an awesome view to 18 four-thousanders and it is the starting point of tours in summer and winter. Jegihorn has a panorama via ferrata, the highest in the western Alps, and on the way to Lagginhorn there is a climbing park with two dozen routes. Although located in the busy area of the aerial cable way Kreuzboden-Hohsaas, the mountain hostel is still a base for climbers. In winter it is a popular restaurant for skiers, too. It is easily accessible for families and offers climbing routes for children nearby.","r_number":2147000291,"city":"Valais","place":"Valais","tel":"+41 27 957 25 54","email":"huette@weissmieshuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.weissmieshuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1646836417_1030651491.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1634813903_1035682187.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1634813907_1060431214.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1529497110_610257990.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1646836404_295843121.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1548334861_946526357.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.14379571627358,7.977791434608481]}}
