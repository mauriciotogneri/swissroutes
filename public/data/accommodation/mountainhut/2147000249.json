{"id":2147000249,"properties":{"title":"Silberhornhütte SAC","abstract":"Accès en hiver n'est pas possible","description":"«A minute hostel in a great landscape» is probably the best way to describe this cabin. Small and simple, the unattended cabin for self-caterers is located on a promontory on Rotbrättlücke between Schwarzmönch and Silberhorn high above Lauterbrunnental. The access trail is long, partly exposed and of alpine character, to be undertaken in dry conditions only. The ascents towards Jungfrau are high alpine, rarely attempted adventures. The view from this extraordinary cabin deep down into the valley is awesome.","r_number":2147000249,"city":"Bernese Alps","place":"Bernese Alps","tel":null,"email":null,"url1_link":"http://www.sac-lauterbrunnen.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522310383_11388384.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1522310383_897917174.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.548987925175055,7.933582306211974]}}
