Those who do not have the experience and equipment for such a tour should entrust themselves to a mountain guide!","description":"Spectacular high alpine cabin. The impressive view from the edge of Grosser Aletschgletscher is earned by glacier hikes and finally an ascent on the long stairway up to the eagle’s nest. Regularly enlarged and renovated, the legendary «island in the sea of ice» has been in existence for almost 150 years. Once it was located 50 metres above Konkordiaplatz, today it's 200 metres. In summer as well as winter it is the starting point for a multitude of high alpine and glacier tours.","r_number":2147000142,"city":"Bernese Alps, Valais","place":"Bernese Alps, Valais","tel":"+41 33 855 13 94","email":"info@konkordiahuette.ch","url1_link":"http://www.konkordiahuette.ch","photo_gallery_big":["https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482224_2121741513.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482226_597952342.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482223_891587470.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482221_1551120136.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482223_763184291.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482041_663014271.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482039_1800545471.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482040_418787785.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482040_13404948.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1549978880_1202136221.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1651482040_1712852053.jpg","https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1549978880_1112568820.jpg"]},"geometry":{"coordinates":[46.50058238027137,8.053224794194698]}}
