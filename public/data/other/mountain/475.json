It is the result of the glacier’s disappearance from the north face. Traversing this moonscape is impressive and easy. The summit, too, is easy to climb. If you want a challenge, prolong the tour by climbing also Piz Forcellina. Even more demanding is the direct traverse from Piz Turba to Piz Forcellina by following the ridge.","subtitle":"On the way to the moon","title":"From Juf on the western ridge","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T4","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[1665,1666,1667],"sac_poi_id":2066,"x_coordinate":766606.6740289577,"y_coordinate":142181.10703632823,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:32","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":1665,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_948961814Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_948961814master.jpg","photo_sac_id":257620,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_948961814.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_948961814M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_948961814Mc.jpg","title":"The Turba range viewed from Avers; the ascent is first to Forcellina (left) and then to the summit (the unobtrusive peak to the right)."},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":1666,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248607_2009908926Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248607_2009908926master.jpg","photo_sac_id":257621,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248607_2009908926.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248607_2009908926M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248607_2009908926Mc.jpg","title":"„Icarus“ on Piz Turba"},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":1667,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_147691569Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_147691569master.jpg","photo_sac_id":257622,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_147691569.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_147691569M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1536248608_147691569Mc.jpg","title":"View from Piz Turba to Piz Duan"}]}}
