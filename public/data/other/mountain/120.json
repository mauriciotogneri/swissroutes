Between October and December and between January and May the whole area may be inaccessible due to military target practice.","subtitle":"Between rock faces and steep grassy slopes","title":"Western ridge","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T5-","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[393,394,395],"sac_poi_id":112,"x_coordinate":647576.1994606592,"y_coordinate":173425.13685925445,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:13:58","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":393,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585273_1686220911Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585273_1686220911master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247606,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585273_1686220911.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585273_1686220911M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585273_1686220911Mc.jpg","title":"Axalphoren with the main summit on the right and the western summit."},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":394,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585409_1181885193Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585409_1181885193master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247607,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585409_1181885193.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585409_1181885193M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585409_1181885193Mc.jpg","title":"Below the western summit, looking over to the main summit with its exposed ridge."},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":395,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585668_1322988176Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585668_1322988176master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247610,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585668_1322988176.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585668_1322988176M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512585668_1322988176Mc.jpg","title":"Descending from Axalphoren via LÃ¼tschental."}]}}
