Limidario” on the Swiss map. However, if you ascend through Val di Bordei to the summit, you will find Ghiridone painted on prominent boulders. So, what is the correct name?\nBoth. Very often in the Ticino canton more than one name is in use, one in the local dialect and another in the standard Italian language. While Ghiridone is the standard name used by many in the region around Locarno and Centovalli, the people from Brissago prefer calling the mountain Gridone in their dialect, formerly also Cridone or Gredone. Monte Limidario is used on the Italian side of the border and is derived from the Latin word “limes” (border). But it may not have denoted today’s border between Switzerland and Italy, but the boundary line between pastures and rock.","subtitle":"An overwhelming vantage point with a number of names","title":"Rasa - Gridone - Rifugio al Legn","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T3","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[588,589],"sac_poi_id":4112,"x_coordinate":693474.1560741286,"y_coordinate":108705.8818788125,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:06","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":588,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515425337_1866771108Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515425337_1866771108master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248623,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515425337_1866771108.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515425337_1866771108M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515425337_1866771108Mc.jpg","title":"Gridone (centre) and Monte Rosa"},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":589,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515419869_312566618Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515419869_312566618master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248621,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515419869_312566618.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515419869_312566618M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515419869_312566618Mc.jpg","title":"Viewed from Valle Vigezzo, Gridone (left) and Rocce del Gridone look impressive."}]}}
