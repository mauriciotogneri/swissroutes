Mighty jagged rocks tower left and right of the route, red amphibolite lets Ofenhoren shine as if on fire, and summiteers enjoy a vertiginous view to the Guttannen village 2000 metres down below. The alluvial plain Obrist Diechter, one of the gems of the Grimsel area, is a destination in its own right. From there Ofenhoren can already be seen, and it is hard to believe that it is so easy to climb.","subtitle":"In red rocks above Grimsel granite","title":"From Gelmersee","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T4+","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[403,404],"sac_poi_id":1320,"x_coordinate":668517.3714723886,"y_coordinate":166782.67121890714,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:13:59","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":403,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512642731_1866683148Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512642731_1866683148master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247621,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512642731_1866683148.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512642731_1866683148M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512642731_1866683148Mc.jpg","title":"The lovely alluvial plain Obrist Diechter full of cotton grass"},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":404,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605011145_121207748Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605011145_121207748master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247619,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605011145_121207748.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605011145_121207748M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1605011145_121207748Mc.jpg","title":"The ascent is on the reddish rock basin left of the Ofenhoren summit."}]}}
