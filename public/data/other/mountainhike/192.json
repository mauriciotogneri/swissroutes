From the end of the reservoir the trail ascends in pastures to TÃ¤lliboden overgrown with cotton grass and continues along inclined rock ledges and on blockfields up to the col. It is easier to climb the summit face, which is almost entirely made of blockfields, than it appears from the col. Often on the Italian side ibex are grazing on the ledges between the rocks. Joderhorn is a fantastic vantage point, which provides an impressive insight into the Monte Rosa east face nearby.","subtitle":"Rewarding pyramid-like peak made of talus offering an opportunity to observe ibex","title":"West face (from Monte-Moro-Pass)","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T4","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[2803,2802,564],"sac_poi_id":974,"x_coordinate":642647.23390201,"y_coordinate":93968.15272051099,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:05","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":2803,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575367855_502933288Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575367855_502933288master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248417,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575367855_502933288.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575367855_502933288M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575367855_502933288Mc.jpg","title":"Monte Rosa's east face rises mightily behind Monte-Moro-Pass."},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":2802,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575364872_1834789495Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575364872_1834789495master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248416,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575364872_1834789495.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575364872_1834789495M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1575364872_1834789495Mc.jpg","title":"View to the west and north-west face of Joderhorn"},{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":564,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1514279200_912270290Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1514279200_912270290master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248415,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1514279200_912270290.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1514279200_912270290M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1514279200_912270290Mc.jpg","title":"The pyramid-like peak of Joderhorn towers above Monte-Moro-Pass."}]}}
