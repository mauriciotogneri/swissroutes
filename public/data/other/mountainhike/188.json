The ascent is rather short, but the north ridge has a few climbing passages, which give the tour a challenging touch. Thus the traverse of Tochuhorn becomes a multifaceted hiking tour. There are other routes to the mountain which offer no difficulties, making it a rewarding destination for pure pleasure seekers.","subtitle":"Short, but challenging tour above Simplonpass","title":"Traverse north ridgeâ€“west ridge","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T5","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[559],"sac_poi_id":1982,"x_coordinate":643345.5975308631,"y_coordinate":122940.40884345821,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:05","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":559,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1580737589_1706390307Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1580737589_1706390307master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248346,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1580737589_1706390307.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1580737589_1706390307M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1580737589_1706390307Mc.jpg","title":"Tochhorn above Simplonpass with its two summits"}]}}
