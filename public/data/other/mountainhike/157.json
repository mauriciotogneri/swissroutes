This makes Fluebrig a landmark between Sihltal and WÃ¤gital, visible from afar. Even more: there is no other twothousander closer to the largest Swiss city. Between Zurich Bellevue and the peak the aerial distance is only 43 km. Actually there are three peaks, whose highest is called Diethelm. That is the one we want to explore here.","subtitle":"The twothousander closest to Zurich","title":"Traverse of Fluebrig from south to north","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T4","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[487],"sac_poi_id":500,"x_coordinate":709786.8023637658,"y_coordinate":213215.78015939234,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:02","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":487,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513353017_984583139Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513353017_984583139master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247957,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513353017_984583139.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513353017_984583139M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1513353017_984583139Mc.jpg","title":"Fluebrig viewed from the west.
