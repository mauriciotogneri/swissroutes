The summit is a relatively easily reachable vantage point in front of the mighty Wetterhorn with a splendid view to the Schreckhorn chain and Grindelwald deep below. However, some experience in alpine terrain is required. As an alternative or an additional tour for a second day we recommend  a round trip to Oberer Grindelwaldgletscher, as it is worthwile spending the night in Glecksteinhütte after having mastered the long ascent.","subtitle":"A dream for those who are unafraid of heights","title":"Via Glecksteinhütte","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T4","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[407,408],"sac_poi_id":5997,"x_coordinate":650429.6249020571,"y_coordinate":164816.03474650977,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:13:59","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":407,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512659758_250595438Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512659758_250595438master.jpg","photo_sac_id":247652,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512659758_250595438.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512659758_250595438M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1512659758_250595438Mc.jpg","title":"Just a few steps away from Chrinnenhorn.
