As most winters lacked snow all too often, the means of transportation were rarely operating. That was not profitable: no revenues, but expenses nevertheless. The lifts needed investment, and obtaining a concession costs a lot of money. Therefore, the Tamaro transportation company said goodbye to the unreliable winter weather and turned to summer activities. A fun park with a high-wire garden, toboggan run, playground with a frog pond, 400 m long flying fox, mountain bike infrastructure, launch pad for paragliders etc. was built. And even those interested in high culture were considered. Egidio Cattaneo, a Ticino entrepreneur who made money in the oil business and the former owner of the Tamaro transportation company, had a chapel built on Monte Tamaro in honour of his late wife. He assigned the project to his friend, the architect Mario Botta. The chapel Santa Maria degli Angeli is very special and deserves a visit. Even if you are not into sacral buildings, the form and location of this chapel will leave a lasting impression on you.\nAlso, the second part of the tour and the endpoint are worthwhile. Monte Gambarogno is a first-class vantage point, and Indemini is one of the best-preserved mountain villages of Sottoceneri.","subtitle":"Action and solitude","title":"Monte Tamaro and Monte Gambarogno","sac_type":"mountain_hiking","mountain_hiking_difficulty":"T3","alpine_tour_difficulty":null,"alpine_climbing_difficulty":null,"grade":null,"height_climbing_wall":null,"via_ferrata_difficulty":null,"ski_tour_difficulty":null,"mountaineering_sacphoto_ids":[590],"sac_poi_id":1928,"x_coordinate":710367.0491283817,"y_coordinate":106826.18309676525,"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:14:06","sac_photos":[{"change_date":"2023-03-30 12:08:27","id":590,"photo_big":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515490379_361521516Ma.jpg","photo_master":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515490379_361521516master.jpg","photo_sac_id":248624,"photo_sac_original":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515490379_361521516.jpg","photo_small":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515490379_361521516M.jpg","photo_standard":"https://static.suissealpine.sac-cas.ch/1515490379_361521516Mc.jpg","title":"The descent from Monte Tamaro towards Monte Gambarogno; view to the Maggia delta"}]}}
