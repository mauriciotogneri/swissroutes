But not so Pizzo Campo Tencia: it is the highest all Ticino summit. In old pictures you can see that it was a heavily glaciered summit with huge seracs, and the first ascent in 1867 required many complicated detours. The glaciers have shrunk considerably in the meantime, and easier routes were discovered. Therefore, Pizzo Campo Tencia has become a premium target for alpine hikers.",
