Also worth remembering is the view of the big Griesgletscher, the beautifully formed summits of the Blinnenhorn range and the many lakes, some of them natural, some artificial. That the schistous and gravelly ground you hike on sometimes runs away under your feet needs to be taken as a challenge.",
