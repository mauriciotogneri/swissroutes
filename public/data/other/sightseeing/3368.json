        "abstract": "As early as the 16th century there was a busy bathing industry here, but it experienced its prime in the 19th century with the construction of the Albulastrasse, the road running through the valley.",
        "description": "In 2001 the former spa was replaced by a small, modern wellness centre with an integrated range of spa treatments. Bad Alvaneu has indoor and outdoor pools, the water temperatures of which remain constant at 34Â°C. The pools are fed by the Alvaneu sulphur springs. And for that feelgood experience the spa also offers a steam bath, a Finnish sauna and a bio sauna, bubble loungers and Jacuzzis.\n\nSulphur springs such as the ones in Alvaneu are some of the most important mineral springs there are. Sulphur is involved in many important processes of metabolism. It is especially good for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, skin conditions and circulatory problems. Needless to say, one can also just dip into the Bad Alvaneu pools for the pure enjoyment of it.",
