High above the Aare Loop, you can enjoy peace and relaxation in this beautifully landscaped park. The fragrance and colors of more than 250 rose varieties are sure to mesmerize you.\n\nFrom 1765 to 1877, the Rose Garden served as a cemetery for the lower part of the city. The garden became a public park in 1913. Between 1956 and 1962, the park was redesigned, and the rose beds were supplemented by additional flowers, including azalea bushes and an iris garden.\n\nStroll past the garden's historical lawns and ponds, or treat yourself to a leisurely hour in the reading garden of the unique library dedicated to dialect literature. You'll also find a restaurant with an outstanding view, a large playground and an enchanting lily pond.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BT1960_a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BT1960_a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BT778_b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bern Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofplatz 10a","zip":"3011","place":"Bern","tel":"+41 (0)31 328 12 12","fax":null,"email":"info@bern.com","url1_link":"https://www.bern.com","x_coordinate":601651.725916805,"y_coordinate":200091.06153866948,"change_date":null,"id":678,"r_key":678,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bern.com/de/detail/rosengarten","touristic_region":6}}
