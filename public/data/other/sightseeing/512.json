Here, already in 1324 Berne had its first bailiwick and thus constructed what is now one of the oldest buildings in the canton of Berne.","description":"The castle towers majestically above the little town of Laupen and the magnificent castle is a landmark of the region and an architectural monument of national importance. Through the ages, Laupen castle was repeatedly besieged and attacked by enemy troops and consequently reinforced time and time again. A striking fact is the sight of the up to 3-meter ring wall still preserved today. Showpiece of the castle is the medieval hall; representing one of the best preserved castle halls in Switzerland.\n\nAnd if you'd like to slip into the role of lord or lady of the castle manor - or if you're looking for a unique and intimate setting for a banquet, company gathering or even a wedding; the Knight's Hall or castle cellar can be rented for your special event.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8022_Schloss-Laupen_2a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8022_Schloss-Laupen_2a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8022_Schloss-Laupen_1b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Tourismus Region Laupen","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 63","zip":"3177","place":"Laupen","tel":"+41 (0)31 740 10 60","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@regionlaupen.ch","url1_link":"https://www.regionlaupen.ch","x_coordinate":584990.0474602034,"y_coordinate":194581.39265763754,"change_date":null,"id":512,"r_key":512,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://hwww.regionlaupen.ch","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
