        "description": "Mouthwatering smells from the sausages and bacon suspended from the smokehouse ceiling greet the visitor. Here, tradition has been lovingly nurtured over the centuries. The smokehouse is equipped to offer visitors sampling sessions, guided tours or meals.\n\nThe Banneret Wisard farmhouse in the village of Grandval is of the «devant-huis» type with a covered area, open on one side, connecting the house to the barn and stables. A single roof, currently wood-shingled as it would have been originally, covers all three parts of the building. The pyramid-shaped roof is particularly worthy of note.",
