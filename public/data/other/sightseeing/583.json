The paintings are reminiscent of those in the Arena Chapel in the North Italian town of Padua. And because the Florentine Giotto di Bondone worked there, it is conceivable that the frescoes in Stuls were executed by students of the great Giotto. The paintings fascinate the eye though their ingenious overall composition and fine colour harmonies, demonstrating the high level of Italian wall painting in the mid-14th century.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7958_Evangelische-Kirche-Stuls_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7958_Evangelische-Kirche-Stuls_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7958_Evangelische-Kirche-Stuls_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bergün Filisur Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Plazi 2A","zip":"7482","place":"Bergün/Bravuogn","tel":"+41 (0)81 407 11 52","fax":null,"email":"info@berguen-filisur.ch","url1_link":"https://berguen-filisur.graubuenden.ch/de","x_coordinate":775501.2538212205,"y_coordinate":169132.2570782276,"change_date":null,"id":583,"r_key":583,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.baukultur.gr.ch/de_DE/address/reformierte_kirche_stugl_stuls.24651","touristic_region":1}}
