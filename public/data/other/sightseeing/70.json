Today it houses the town and archaeological Museum and in one room a small exhibition commemorates the Pace Conference held in Locarno in 1925.","description":"The first testimonies of this historical building date back to 998. The centre core of the castle was built in the the 13th and 15th century. Before its destruction, beginning in 1531, the castle occupied a much vaster area than it does today. To the south there used to be an old port with a wall protecting the castle from being flooded by the river Maggia and to the town side there was a fortress wall. The 15th-century inner courtyard with richly inlaid ceilings is also very interesting.\n\nThe castle houses the town and archaeological museum, displaying valuable vases and blown-glass goblets and artifacts from Roman times. One room commemorates the Peace Conference held in Locarno in 1925.\n\nNext to the Castle the is the Rivellino, a historical bulwark attributed to Leonardo da Vinci by historical documents and recent expert research.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/12727_Visconti_Schloss_Locarno_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/12727_Visconti_Schloss_Locarno_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/12727_Visconti_Schloss_Locarno_2b1.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Ascona-Locarno Turismo","name_2":null,"street":"Piazza Stazione / Bahnhof SBB","zip":"6600","place":"Locarno-Muralto","tel":"+41 (0)848 091 091","fax":null,"email":"info@ascona-locarno.com","url1_link":"https://www.ascona-locarno.com","x_coordinate":704587.9860270289,"y_coordinate":113833.89310052186,"change_date":null,"id":70,"r_key":70,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.ascona-locarno.com/en/commons/details/Il-castello-Visconteo/2957.html","touristic_region":12}}
