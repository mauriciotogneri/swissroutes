An architectural jewel from the Gothic period, St. Nicholas cathedral was built between 1283 and 1490.","description":"Anyone who climbs the 368 steps to the top of the 74-metre high tower will be justly rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the city of Fribourg. Built between 1283 and 1490, St Nicholas Cathedral is a superb example of Gothic architecture at its best.\n\nThe stained-glass windows, painted by the Polish artist Jozef Mehoffer between 1896 and 1936, are one of the most important collections in Europe of religious stained-glass windows from the Art Nouveau period. The series was completed in the 1970s by the French artist Alfred Manessier.\n\nThe cathedral’s organs, built between 1824 and 1834, are a blend of the Classical and the Romantic. They are the work of a local organ-maker, Aloys Mooser. His instruments very quickly acquired international repute and were admired by famous musicians such as Franz Liszt and Anton Bruckner.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7970_Kathedrale_St_Niklaus_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7970_Kathedrale_St_Niklaus_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7970_Kathedrale_St_Niklaus_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Fribourg Region","name_2":null,"street":"Rte de la Glâne 107","zip":"1701","place":"Fribourg","tel":"+41 (0)26 407 70 20","fax":null,"email":"information@fribourgregion.ch","url1_link":"https://www.fribourgregion.ch","x_coordinate":578945.1987316232,"y_coordinate":183938.5346564398,"change_date":null,"id":472,"r_key":472,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.fribourgregion.ch/en/P5445/st-nicholas-cathedral-fribourg?group=536","touristic_region":13}}
