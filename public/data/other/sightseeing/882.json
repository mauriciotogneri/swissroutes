The large pump track and dirt park consists of various table jumps, rollers and banked turns, which allow different combinations. This is a great opportunity for children and teens to playfully improve their biking skills.\n\nIn addition to the pump track and dirt park, Viererfeld also has a “bicycle playground” for the smallest bike fans and a short jump trail for those with some experience. Jumps can be practiced and perfected in the loop. \n\nFor the time being, the Viererfeld pump track is a multi-year temporary facility, but it is expected to be integrated into the future neighbourhood park.\n\n\nSurface area: 3000 m2 \nSurface: natural ground","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_2_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_10_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_11_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_12_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_1_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_2_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_3_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_4_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_5_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_6_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_7_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_8_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_9_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_10_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_11_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_12_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_1_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_2_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_3_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_4_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_5_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_6_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_7_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_8_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Pumptrack_Viererfeld_9_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Bern Welcome","name_2":null,"street":"Amthausgasse 4","zip":"3001","place":"Bern","tel":"+41 (0)31 328 12 12","fax":null,"email":"info@bern.com","url1_link":"https://www.bern.com","x_coordinate":600005.9195844774,"y_coordinate":201188.10939824022,"change_date":null,"id":882,"r_key":882,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.sportamt-bern.ch/sportanlage/pumptrack-viererfeld","touristic_region":6}}
