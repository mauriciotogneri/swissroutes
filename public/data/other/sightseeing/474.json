Jean Tinguely and his wife Niki de St Phalle left a profound mark on Fribourg’s cultural and artistic life.","description":"A former tramway depot near the Fribourg Museum of Art and History is home to the Espace Jean Tinguely - Niki de Saint Phalle. It was specially designed to accommodate the works of the artists.\n\nJean Tinguely was a leading exponent of kinetic art. His sculptures gradually evolved towards works that appealed to several senses at the same time: sight, hearing, touch and sometimes even smell. Niki de St Phalle, a French-born artist, was Jean Tinguely's wife. Her most well-known and memorable works are probably Les Nanas.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7972_Jean_Tinguely_Niki-de-Saint_Phalle_1_a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7972_Jean_Tinguely_Niki-de-Saint_Phalle_1_a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7972_Jean_Tinguely_Niki-de-Saint_Phalle_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Fribourg Region","name_2":null,"street":"Route de la Glâne 107","zip":"1701","place":"Fribourg","tel":"+41 (0)26 407 70 20","fax":null,"email":"information@fribourgregion.ch","url1_link":"https://www.fribourgregion.ch","x_coordinate":578783.0372097485,"y_coordinate":184058.06015866186,"change_date":null,"id":474,"r_key":474,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.fr.ch/mahf/culture-et-tourisme/musees/espace-jean-tinguely-niki-de-saint-phalle","touristic_region":13}}
