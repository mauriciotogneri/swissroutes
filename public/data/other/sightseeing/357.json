The canton's underwater world is also shown.\n\nThe foundation for this extensive collection was already laid back in the 19th and 20th centuries by naturalists from the Grisons. At first the exhibits could only be viewed by the district school, but in 1872 it was opened to the public for the first time. After several relocations the new museum building was opened in 1981, and here the permanent exhibition ensures an interesting experience of nature.\n\nThe Museum of Natural History in Chur offers lectures especially aimed at families, during which children find out interesting facts about natural phenomena. Among other things, they learn how animals care for themselves, how wild animals perceive their environment and how the animals survive the harsh winter.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8905_Buendner-Naturmuseum_2a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8905_Buendner-Naturmuseum_2a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8905_Buendner-Naturmuseum_3b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Chur Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofplatz 3","zip":"7001","place":"Chur","tel":"+41 (0)81 252 18 18","fax":null,"email":"info@churtourismus.ch","url1_link":"https://www.churtourismus.ch","x_coordinate":759801.7423835901,"y_coordinate":191370.00000781147,"change_date":null,"id":357,"r_key":357,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.naturmuseum.gr.ch","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
