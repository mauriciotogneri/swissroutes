An enthralling exhibition, moments of intensity. High place of the spirit of sport and the Games, the Olympic Museum displays interactive gardens and exhibition spaces in an idyllic setting. It is the result of Pierre de Coubertin's lifelong dream.","description":"The Olympic Museum offers 3000 m2 of exhibition space, and rethought thematic. From The Olympic Park, with its sports installations and sculptures, the TOM Shop, to the TOM Café and its menus inspired by the cuisine of cities who have hosted the Games, you will have great stories to tell. Take your time, the view of the lake is already enough to take your breath away.\n\nThree levels deploy an ultra-modern museography: the Museum has over 1500 exhibits and 150 screens. The first theme presented is the constantly expanding phenomenon of the Olympic World. The second floor is entirely devoted to the Olympic Games. The third part of the exhibition concerns the Olympic Spirit.\n\nThe temporary exhibitions show the Games in all their diversity. Accompanied with the numerous cultural events, they will open new doors to reveal different ways of experiencing the Games.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_0312.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_0312.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_0245.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11998_Olympisches_Museum_4a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11998_Olympisches_Museum_3b.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_0551.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_4854.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_5262_bis.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_0619.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_9652.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_4502.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_8530.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Das_olymische_Museum_MG_9034.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Le Musée Olympique","name_2":null,"street":"Quai d'Ouchy 1","zip":"1006","place":"Lausanne","tel":"+41 21 621 65 11","fax":null,"email":"info.museum@olympic.org","url1_link":"https://www.olympic.org/museum","x_coordinate":538247.72665083,"y_coordinate":151138.9915091867,"change_date":null,"id":260,"r_key":260,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.olympic.org/museum","touristic_region":9,"canton":27}}
