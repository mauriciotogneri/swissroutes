        "description": "Ever since 1912, a cable railway has brought visitors, in a quarter of an hour, from Cassarate to Mount Bré (933 metres above sea level), a locality offering many opportunities to the visitor: a big, well equipped picnic area, where it is possible to grill food, walks that are accessible to families even with small children and more difficult mountain hikes. The village of Bré has kept intact its characteristic of ancient rural village, and in time, numerous artworks have also embellished it. You will find the works by Pasquale Gilardi, also called Lelèn, the frescoes by Joseph Birò in the Church of San Fedele, the Schmid Museum with the works, which the artist left, together with his home, to his Municipality of adoption and an open air museum consisting in the works of Aligu Sassu, Armando Losa, Emilio Rissone, Giuliano Togni, Giancarlo Tamagni, Piergiorgio Piffaretti and others.\n\nOf course, there are also restaurants, tiny and large grotti with panoramic terraces that offer a bird's eye view of the Lake of Lugano and of its surrounding mountains.",
