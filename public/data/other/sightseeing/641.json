In the Twingi gorge, the area description «Gäh Tod» (sudden death) reveals that this is the most dangerous section of the road to Binn.","description":"A link from Ernen to Binn must have existed as early as the 14th century. however it is impossible to state with any certainty that this is the one below today’s road. The route through the Twingi was often perilous in winter and Binntal was frequently cut off from the outside world for weeks until the tunnel between Ausserbinn and Binn was built in 1965. Avalanches and rock falls which crashed down into the Twingi-Schlucht gorge often blocked the only negotiable road.\n\nSince the tunnel has provided the once self-sufficient village with winter-safe access, the old road offers cyclists and walkers a spectacularly scenic experience. With its tunnels, retaining walls and boundary walls, it represents an impressive monument to the construction of those times. In order to avoid having to build bridges in the deep narrow gorges, the streams were diverted below the road with water flows and tunnels cut through rock faces. The longest tunnel has two openings providing views down into the gorge.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/IVS_06_02_Twingi.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/IVS_06_02_Twingi.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_3.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_72.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_2.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_7.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_53.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_12.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20080527_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_92.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20100902_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_FRB_48.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20110421_Wallis_Binn_Twingischlucht_AdrianKraeuchi_Landplan_3.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Bundesinventar der historischen Verkehrswege der Schweiz (IVS)","name_2":null,"street":" ","zip":" ","place":" ","tel":" ","fax":null,"email":" ","url1_link":"https://www.ivs.admin.ch","x_coordinate":655539.7606292892,"y_coordinate":135339.83182398806,"change_date":null,"id":641,"r_key":641,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://s.geo.admin.ch/6fb183c570","touristic_region":11}}
