        "abstract": "For almost 1000 years Kyburg Castle has sat enthroned above the river TÃ¶ss. It was the family seat of the dynasty of the Counts of Kyburg. Later the bailiffs of Zurich resided in the buildings. Nowadays the museum tells the history of the Kyburg.",
        "description": "The museum has revived the life back then in the castle. Whilst roaming the castle from cellar to attic you will learn, for example, what the bailiff's wife dished up for her guests, what a knight wore beneath his suit of armour and what happened to a thief. You can take a look at a lavish medieval festival and even try on a medieval slip-on robe.\r\nIn addition, the baroque castle garden will be open from the end of May, where cabbage, turnips, chard and herbs are grown again like in the olden days.",
