        "description": "The Zermatt pump track is located on the Chrome athletic field and accessible during the summer months. \n\nKids will discover the fun of mountain biking as they complete their first laps and negotiate rollers – or they can enjoy the obstacle park right next to it. \n\nOn the pump track, here at the foot of the Matterhorn, those with more experience will train endurance, strength, balance, and speed, all at the same time. These riding skills can subsequently be used on the trails of Zermatt.",
