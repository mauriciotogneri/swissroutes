A beautiful journey to the land of white gold: salt has been an important source of income since ancient times.","description":"A shepherd discovered saline sources in the 15th century on an Alpine meadow above Bex. Salt was then extracted from the mountain through mines, an activity still undertaken today. Annual production amounts to 35'000 tons commercialised by a limited company.\n\nAn audiovisual presentation and an exhibition have been installed in a former reservoir dug in 1826. They describe the three centuries of salt commercialisation and the salt extraction methods used. The adventure continues down to the core of the mountain, which is accessible by a small train and on foot, to experience the depth, the oppression and the efforts spent on building a maze consisting of 50 km of galleries. On the day of Sainte Barbe, the miners' patron saint, celebrated on December 5, a trek mine invites individual visitors to explore this maze.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7988_Salzbergwerk_Bex_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7988_Salzbergwerk_Bex_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7988_alzbergwerk_Bex_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Office du Tourisme de Bex","name_2":null,"street":"Avenue de la Gare 24","zip":"1880","place":"Bex","tel":"+41 (0)21 613 26 26","fax":null,"email":"info@bex-tourisme.ch","url1_link":"https://www.mines.ch","x_coordinate":568264.2695755562,"y_coordinate":125252.61756360586,"change_date":null,"id":289,"r_key":289,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.mines.ch","touristic_region":9}}
