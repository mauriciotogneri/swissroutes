        "abstract": "There is only one in Western Switzerland. What is it? A revolving panoramic restaurant called «Kuklos».  You will be enjoying a spectacular 360 degree view at an altitude of 2,048 metres.",
        "description": "The panoramic Kuklos Restaurant, which is entirely made of glass, is located next to Tour d'Aï and Tour de Famelon and offers visitors a feast for the eyes. You will behold Lake Geneva, Mont-Blanc, Dents du Midi and the Alps. The restaurant makes a full rotation within 1 hour 30 minutes, during which time you’ll enjoy carefully prepared dishes: from the daily menu to special treats fulfilling your heart’s desire.\n\nWhat’s more, Kuklos is the only panoramic futuristic-looking restaurant running on green energy. Thanks to its solar panels and its vertical wind pump, the restaurant now uses the energy of the sun and the wind for its rotation. Visitors can also discover the potential of renewable energies on the didactic path near the restaurant.",
