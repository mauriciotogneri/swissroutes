The view of the Valais alps is therefore equally impressive.\n\nBut don't lose sight of the circuit for all the panoramic views: the waves, bowls and steep wall curves are perfect to hone your technique.   \n\nTogether with the kids trail with a conveyor belt, the pump track makes up the Raiffeisen Bike Park Aletsch. Right next to it is a sun terrace with a view of the park and the mountains. \n\nSurface: asphalt\nArea: 600m2","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_1_M.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_1_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_2_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_3_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_4_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_5_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_6_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_7_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_8_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_1_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_2_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_3_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_4_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_5_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_6_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_7_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Bettmeralp_8_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch","aletscharena.ch"],"photo_gallery_author":["RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli","RAPHAEL WERNLI                      ; Raphael Wernli"],"name":"Aletsch Arena","name_2":null,"street":"Furkastrasse 39","zip":"3983","place":"MÃ¶rel-Filet","tel":"+41 (0)27 928 58 58","fax":null,"email":"info@aletscharena.ch","url1_link":"https://www.aletscharena.ch  ","x_coordinate":648109.4965229417,"y_coordinate":138060.86596296926,"change_date":null,"id":856,"r_key":856,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.valais.ch/en/activities/mountain-bike/pumptracks","touristic_region":11}}
