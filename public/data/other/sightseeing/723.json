With an area of some 1,000 m2, the asphalt piste includes hills, waves and steep curves and is suitable for bikes, skateboards and kickboards.","description":"On a pump track, mountain bikes, skateboards and kickboards can only move forward when the front and rear wheels are actively loaded and unloaded, i.e. «pumped». Experienced riders can make jumps over the waves. What is different about the Sils facility is that the track is not fixed as it is with classic pump tracks, but one can move freely over the entire surface. The possibilities for choosing a line are practically unlimited. The hills and the 360° pump wave were especially developed and built as new elements for the Pump Park. \n\nBut despite its unique features, the Pump Park, like any classic pump track, can be used by all bikers - everyone from young children to experts - according to ability. The Pump Park is located in the schoolhouse grounds in Sils and is open every day from 7 am to 10 pm. There is no charge. Parking is available nearly at the Palazzo, but not at the school building itself.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_2.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_1.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_2.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_3.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_4.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_5.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_6.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumppark_Sils_velosolutions_ch_spitznagel_ch_7.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","",""],"name":"Gemeinde Sils im Domleschg","name_2":null,"street":"Ausserdorf 9","zip":"7414","place":"Sils im Domleschg","tel":"+41 (0)81 651 12 79","fax":null,"email":"info@sils-id.ch","url1_link":"https://www.sils-id.ch","x_coordinate":753875.8927642775,"y_coordinate":174114.68513591605,"change_date":null,"id":723,"r_key":723,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.viamala.ch/de/aktivitaeten/sommer/biken","touristic_region":1}}
