        "description": "The castle, erected on what’s now known as Thun’s castle hill, was constructed by the Duke of Zähringen between 1180 & 1190. Today, visitors witness an intact and magnificent emblem of the past. The castle, which was inherited by the noble Kyburg gentry in 1218 following the death of Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen, changed hands again in 1384 and today belongs to the city of Berne.\n\nThe museum is housed in the five large tower rooms and grants a comprehensive and most interesting view of cultural history. The knight’s hall (Rittersaal), which stems from the Zähringer era, forms what could well be named the castle jewel - and the corner turrets naturally provide matchless views over the town and surrounding landscapes.",
