It's a structure, which dairy production is accompanied by other activities.","description":"Coming from the north, Airolo is the first village in Ticino. The surrounding countryside is a place for countless excursions. Ticino has a long tradition of cheese-making. The large variety of alpine herbs growing in the alpine pastures gives the cheese a particular aromatic flavor. The Gotthard cheese dairy in Airolo, produces 3 prestigious cheese pastes, but also ice cream, yogurt, butter, etc. from the milk of the cows in the Gotthard region. These products can be directly purchased at the diaryâ€™s shop or savored at the restaurant. The dairy offers the opportunity to see how products are made, with a guided tour of the establishment (upon reservation), and with an exhibit on traditional methods of Swiss cheese-making. Visitors also have the exclusive opportunity to make their own cheese using the milk produced by the local cows. Moreover, after 3 months of aging the cheese can be sent home (within Europe) as a nice souvenir from Ticino.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11385_Schaukaeserei_del_Gottardo_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11385_Schaukaeserei_del_Gottardo_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11385_Schaukaeserei_del_Gottardo_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Bellinzonese e Alto Ticino Turismo","name_2":null,"street":"Via della Stazione 22","zip":"6780","place":"Airolo","tel":"+41 (0)91 869 15 33","fax":null,"email":"leventina@bellinzonese-altoticino.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bellinzonese-altoticino.ch","x_coordinate":689181.3988160478,"y_coordinate":153208.90351207633,"change_date":null,"id":154,"r_key":154,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.cdga.ch","touristic_region":12,"canton":19}}
