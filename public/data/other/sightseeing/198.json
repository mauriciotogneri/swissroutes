The garden is right by the lake.","description":"The Chinese garden was a gift from the Chinese partner town of Kunming to the population of Zürich. It was opened in 1994 and is now run by ‘Grün Stadt Zürich.’ It is one of the group of temple gardens and the highest-ranking outside China. According to traditional Chinese geomantics, Zürich’s Chinese garden is in an ideal location between Zürichberg mountain and the lake.\n\nThe garden is an expression of one of the main themes of Chinese culture, \"Three Friends in Winter\" – three plants that together brave the cold season: pine, bamboo and winter cherry. The inscriptions and paintings allude to the uniqueness of the culture of Yunnan which amalgamated diverse influences of various ethnic groups with the Han culture.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9148_Chinagarten-Zuerich_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9148_Chinagarten-Zuerich_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9148_Chinagarten-Zuerich_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Zürich Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Im Hauptbahnhof","zip":"8021","place":"Zürich","tel":"+41 (0)44 215 40 00","fax":null,"email":"information@zuerich.com","url1_link":"https://www.zuerich.com","x_coordinate":684110.9839310411,"y_coordinate":245499.6787328567,"change_date":null,"id":198,"r_key":198,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zuerich.com/en/travel-trade/trade-why-zurich/trade-highlights/Chinagarten-details.html#details","touristic_region":3}}
