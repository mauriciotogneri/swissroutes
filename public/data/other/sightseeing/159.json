The site is located in Boscéaz near Orbe, a small medieval town in the Yverdon-les-Bains region. The mosaics, which were discovered in the mid-19th century, adorned 9 of the 100 rooms of a huge and luxurious Gallo-Roman villa built towards 160 A.D. The villa was destroyed during the invasions and the grounds were used as a quarry in the Middle Ages. No above-ground structures remain.\n\n","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_3a1.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_3a1.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_4b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Office du Tourisme d'Orbe","name_2":null,"street":"Grand-Rue 1","zip":"1350","place":"Orbe","tel":"+41 (0)24 442 92 37","fax":null,"email":"tourisme@orbe.ch","url1_link":"https://www.orbe-tourisme.ch","x_coordinate":531074.0292292862,"y_coordinate":177343.88191744266,"change_date":null,"id":159,"r_key":159,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/P522/orbe-roman-mosaics","touristic_region":9}}
