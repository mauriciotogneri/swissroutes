The site is located in Boscéaz near Orbe, a small medieval town in the Yverdon-les-Bains region. The mosaics, which were discovered in the mid-19th century, adorned 9 of the 100 rooms of a huge and luxurious Gallo-Roman villa built towards 160 A.D. The villa was destroyed during the invasions and the grounds were used as a quarry in the Middle Ages. No above-ground structures remain.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_3a1.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_3a1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11403_Mosaiques_Romaine_4b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Agence ADNV / Office du Tourisme du Nord vaudois","name_2":null,"street":"Avenue de la Gare 2","zip":"1401","place":"Yverdon-les-Bains","tel":"+41 24 423 03 13","fax":null,"email":"tourisme@adnv.ch","url1_link":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/fr/P522/mosaiques-romaines-d-orbe?group=2263","x_coordinate":531074.0292292862,"y_coordinate":177343.88191744266,"change_date":null,"id":159,"r_key":159,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/P522/orbe-roman-mosaics","touristic_region":9,"canton":27}}
