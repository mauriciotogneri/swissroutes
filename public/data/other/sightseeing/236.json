        "description": "Engelberg's most famous tourist attraction is its Benedictine Monastery which marks the middle of the town with its imposing buildings. Founded in 1120, it was destroyed by fire three different times and then rebuilt. The current structure was built between 1735 and 1740. Today, the monastery houses a modern boarding school and two public schools within its walls. Also within its domain are various handcraft operations, carpentry and metal working shops, a florist/nursery, and forestry operations.\n\nPublic tours are offered on a daily basis Wednesday through Saturday between April and June - on a reduced schedule from October to December. For groups of 15 or more persons, tours in German, French and English can be individually scheduled.\n\nThe centerpiece of this monastery is its baroque church, which underwent renovation from 2005-2009. The altar piece by Spiegler and the largest pipe organ in Switzerland are two of the churche's most noteworthy attractions. Visitors can tour the guest wing of the monastery and finish their tour with a visit to the exhibit room.",
