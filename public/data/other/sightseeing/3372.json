Make the most of multiple thermal baths, a wellness area, spa treatments, a fitness centre, a slide during the summer and a play area. If you would like to extend your stay, you can enjoy a meal in one of many restaurants, or stay overnight in the adjacent hotel.","description":"Relax in the world of the Valais mountains. The Bains de Saillon are perfectly situated in the Rhône plain between Martigny and Sion, on the outskirts of Saillon and near the ski resort. The thermal centre offers three baths ranging from 32 °C to 34 °C, a swimming pool and the “Mayens du bien-être” – a sauna village with hammam and a 120-metre long thermal river. Let yourself be pampered in the “Spa Cinq Mondes Saillon” (entry subject to an additional charge). A steam bath and numerous wellness experiences, such as massages, scrubs and facials, await.\n\nThose who want to relax for more than one day can stay overnight in the adjacent 4-star hotel complex. The 148 rooms offer great views of the Valais mountains, the village of Isérables and the medieval Saillon. The themed restaurants have every taste covered: from Italian cuisine to French brasserie-style, and from burgers to Valais specialities. Meanwhile, children can let off steam in the play area by climbing the magical tree, which stands right next to the Piazza Grande restaurant. The food truck and the shaded terrace allow parents to keep a constant eye on their children. A slide, a pentaglide and a paddling pool round off the family experience during the summer.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-rivière-thermale©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal©nuno-acacio-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-rivière-thermale©nuno-acacio-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal-enfants©nuno-acacio-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-rivière-thermale-2©nuno-acacio-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-mayens-du-bien-être-1-©-sedrik-nemeth-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-Centre-Thermal-Sarah-Jacquemet-M_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal-enfants-2©nuno-acacio-M_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-rivière-thermale©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal-enfants©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-rivière-thermale-2©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-mayens-du-bien-être-1-©-sedrik-nemeth-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-Centre-Thermal-Sarah-Jacquemet-M_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Bains-de-Saillon-centre-thermal-enfants-2©nuno-acacio-M_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["© Nuno Acácio","© Nuno Acácio","© Nuno Acácio","© Nuno Acácio","© sedrik nemeth ","","© Nuno Acácio"],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","",""],"name":"Bains de Saillon","name_2":null,"street":"Rue du Centre Thermal 16","zip":"1913","place":"Saillon","tel":"+41 (0)27 602 11 11","fax":null,"email":"info@bainsdesaillon.ch","url1_link":"http://www.bainsdesaillon.ch/","x_coordinate":581254.5945000099,"y_coordinate":113565.78772926508,"change_date":null,"id":3372,"r_key":3372,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.bainsdesaillon.ch","touristic_region":11,"canton":7}}
