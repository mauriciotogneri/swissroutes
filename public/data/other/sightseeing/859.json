        "description": "There are three downhill trails in the Bellwald bike park, of which the \"National\" trail is quite special: professional competitions are regularly held on this fast and flowing downhill course, such as the finals of the IXS Swiss Downhill Cup. Due to demanding traverses and the very high speed which requires a lot of concentration, the trail is classified as black. It starts at the middle station. You ride through open meadows and forest passages on natural ground. Exciting elements such as a courage gorge, a rock garden or a 200-metre-long jumpline await you.\n\nThe two-kilometre-long \"Denis X-Trail\" is a blue trail and offers more leisurely riding fun. It features good grip and is also suitable for the less experienced. The descent starts at the middle station as well, but leads westwards. On the natural ground without bumps or roots, an allround mountain bike is sufficient.\n\nThe four-kilometre-long \"Forest Bump Trail\" is mostly flat and was built with machines. This playful flow trail is fun and fluid to ride. It is aimed particularly at beginners, but advanced riders will certainly enjoy it as well. Optional lines, jumpable waves and tables as well as hidden jumps are part of the program. Absolute beginners can first do a few laps on the pump track. \n\nSurface: natural ground\nArea: 1,000 m2",
