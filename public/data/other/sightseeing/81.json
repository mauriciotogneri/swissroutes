The BÃ¶deli, with the world-famous resort of Interlaken, lies nestled between Lakes Thun and Brienz while the foothills in the north and the four-thousand metre high peaks to the south form a ring around the Harder. The ten-minute ride on the funicular is short and hence all the more spectacular. Another special highlight is the Alpine Wildlife Park. A visit here provides a welcome break from routine and is particularly suitable for families.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11524_Harder_Kulm_Der_Interlakner_Hausberg_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11524_Harder_Kulm_Der_Interlakner_Hausberg_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11524_Harder_Kulm_Der_Interlakner_Hausberg_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Interlaken Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Marktgasse 1","zip":"3800","place":"Interlaken","tel":"+41 (0)33 826 53 00","fax":null,"email":"mail@interlakentourism.ch","url1_link":"https://www.interlaken.ch","x_coordinate":631838.1701327766,"y_coordinate":171998.1834999487,"change_date":null,"id":81,"r_key":81,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/harder-kulm/","touristic_region":6}}
