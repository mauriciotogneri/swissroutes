Gypsum pyramids have formed close to the level of the pass. A road leads from Bex to the untamed and secluded Vallon de Nant. The valley runs in a north-south direction along the Grand Muveran and is terminated by the Dents de Morcles. These limestone mountains are almost 3,000 metres high. Considering its small size, the valley has an enormous variety of flora. The Alpine garden of Le Pont de Nant provides an impression of this variety. The fauna is also very varied and the bird species are particularly worthy of mention.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/33_VallondeNant4-574738-122.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/33_VallondeNant4-574738-122.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/33_Vallon-de-Nant.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bundesamt für Umwelt","name_2":null,"street":"und Naturdenkmäler von nationaler Bedeutung (BLN)","zip":"BLN-Objekt-Nr.","place":"1503","tel":"-","fax":null,"email":"bln@bafu.admin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bln","x_coordinate":574699.8370117396,"y_coordinate":122329.62262034831,"change_date":null,"id":120,"r_key":120,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bln","touristic_region":9}}
