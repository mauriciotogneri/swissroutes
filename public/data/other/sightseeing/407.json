And the deep-blue lake, with its crystal-clear waters, lies in the idyllic 20 ha large grounds of a traffic-free natural park.","description":"Visitors to the delightful Blausee lake not only discover a jewel situated in a privileged location amidst stunning nature; but also excellent restaurants along with Alpine bio-trout breeding, romantic walks, fun and adventure for children, illuminated parking areas and almost mystic views of the lake at night.\n\nThe crystal-clear waters of the lake, with rich mineral content, remain more or less at a constant temperature of around 8ºc both in summer and winter. And this is the source of the tastiest Blausee lake trout – naturally bred biologically.  Fish here thrive and grow in conditions similar to those in the wilds; the results of which are a particularly firm, fleshy and tasty fish.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9814_Blausee_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9814_Blausee_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9814_Blausee_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"TALK (Tourismus Adelboden-Lenk-Kandersteg) AG","name_2":null,"street":"Äussere Dorfstrasse 26","zip":"3718","place":"Kandersteg","tel":"+41 (0)33 675 80 80","fax":null,"email":"info@kandersteg.ch","url1_link":"https://www.kandersteg.ch","x_coordinate":617369.3140516407,"y_coordinate":153483.11003613556,"change_date":null,"id":407,"r_key":407,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.blausee.ch","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
