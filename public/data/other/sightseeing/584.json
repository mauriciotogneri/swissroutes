This is also a lovely location to relax after exploring the Old Town  - and to enjoy the gardens with their alpine plants and sun terrace. As a special treat, you can round off your visit by exploring the historical labyrinth of mirrors. You won't get lost, but will certainly come out with a smile on your face.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8174_Gletschergarten_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8174_Gletschergarten_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8174_Gletschergarten_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Luzern Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Zentralstrasse 5","zip":"6003","place":"Luzern","tel":"+41 (0)41 227 17 17","fax":null,"email":"luzern@luzern.com","url1_link":"https://www.luzern.com","x_coordinate":666231.1987833196,"y_coordinate":212352.55101457806,"change_date":null,"id":584,"r_key":584,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.luzern.com/en/navpage.cfm?category=CityExperienceLU&subcat=MuseumsLU&id=68667","touristic_region":4,"canton":15}}
