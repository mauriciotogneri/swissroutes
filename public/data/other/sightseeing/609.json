Although Creux de Croue is hidden between Noirmont and CrÃªt-des-Danses and not easily accessible, it is ideal for nature lovers. Appearing like a cleft at Noirmont, Creux de Croue is a deep depression, which was probably caused by erosion and later by the continuous flow of underground waters. The bottom of the valley features a peat bog and a sheep pen. Although this area is well worth a visit, its protection is of the utmost importance.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8415_Talkessel-Creux-du-Croue_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8415_Talkessel-Creux-du-Croue_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8415_Talkessel-Creux-du-Croue_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Office du Tourisme de St-Cergue","name_2":null,"street":"Place Sy-Vieuxville","zip":"1264","place":"St-Cergue","tel":"+41 (0)22 360 13 14","fax":null,"email":"info@st-cergue-tourisme.ch","url1_link":"https://www.st-cergue-tourisme.ch","x_coordinate":498910.6254565543,"y_coordinate":150200.83129088022,"change_date":null,"id":609,"r_key":609,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":null,"touristic_region":9,"canton":27}}
