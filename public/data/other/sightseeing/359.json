Some of his most important works were created here.\n\nThe Segantini Museum, built in 1908 as a kind of memorial to the great painter, makes it possible to have a comprehensive encounter with this artist's work. In addition to the Alpine Triptychon, works from his early period in Brianza and paintings and drawings of Segantini's stay in Savognin as well as of his years in the Engadine can be viewed here - including the famous «Ave Maria at the Crossing».\n\nThe Segantini museum also has a series of special exhibitions.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8908_Segantini-Museum_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8908_Segantini-Museum_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8908_Segantini-Museum_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"St. Moritz Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Via Maistra 12","zip":"7500","place":"St. Moritz","tel":"+41 (0)81 837 33 33","fax":null,"email":"stmoritz@estm.ch","url1_link":"https://www.engadin.stmoritz.ch/stmoritz","x_coordinate":784320.2873306368,"y_coordinate":152478.14996183128,"change_date":null,"id":359,"r_key":359,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.segantini-museum.ch","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
