    "abstract": "Lakes of Amsoldingen and Uebeschi and the adjacent mires near Amsoldingen are witnesses of the Ice Age. The mire landscape around the two lakes includes all of the blanket mire types found in Switzerland.",
    "description": "When the glaciers retreated around 10,000 years ago after the last Ice Age, the moraines and wet basins remained in the Alpine Foreland. In many locations, this special relief resulted in the formation of small lakes and mire landscapes. Lakes of Amsoldingen and Uebeschi are a good example of this phenomenon.\n\nThe two charming lakes are connected but do not have any surface runoff. The natural lakeshores, which give way to blanket mires, are particularly valuable. The mire landscape around the two lakes includes all of the blanket mire types found in Switzerland and provides habitats for numerous bird species.\n\nThe lakes are in private ownership and are not, therefore, accessible to the public. However, Amsoldingen is worth a visit, not just for its natural beauty: its castle and beautiful church, which is over 1,000 years old, are also worth seeing.",
