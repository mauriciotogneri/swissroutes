        "abstract": "Blending ideally into the countryside and with slopes of no more than 30% – this is the essence of the flow trail running from Marbachegg to Marbach. It is suitable in particular for skilled bikers, who will have plenty of fun on the hollows, waves and jumps.",
        "description": "Starting fairly flat and then becoming steeper, the flow trail winds down from Marbachegg to Marbach. Around 4 kilometres long and one metre wide, the route, which runs along the ski slope, is ideal for skilled mountain bikers. Fun elements will bring a huge grin to everyone’s face. On the flow trail, designed with hollows and waves, it is possible to reach the Marbach valley station almost without using your brakes – in other words you can “flow” there. Fans of table jumps will have a great time too, on this flow trail that has been created using only natural materials. You can roll over the jumps and also bypass the steeper runs if you are not confident. These are the perfect conditions for improving your technique. \n\nAnother plus point: arriving at the bottom, you can travel back up to Marbachegg very conveniently on the gondola lift, where you can take the trail again. If you need a break in between, you will find an inviting terrace with local food at the mountain guesthouse in Marbachegg, right next to the mountain station. You can enjoy a superb view of the impressive Schrattenfluh, the striking Hohgant and the Bernese Alps from there.\n\nThe fares are very family-friendly in Marbach too: you can travel on the gondola lift, including bike transport, from CHF 22.00. This is even included in the season ticket (valid in summer and winter). In addition to the flow trail, there are attractive bike routes in and around Marbach: for example, the «All around the Schrattenfluh» («Rund um die Schrattenfluh») tour or the «Marbacher panorama tour» («Marbacher Panoramarunde»), where you return to the starting point in Marbach via the flow trail.",
