It acquired its major importance in the 13th century. Its owners were treated as equals by the lords of Grandson and Estavayer. The castle was occupied by the Swiss Confederates from 1474 to 1475 and then destroyed by the Bernese in 1536.\n\nThe square tower of St-Martin is 22 m high. It offers a stunning view of the Jura and the gorges made by the Vaux and Flonzel brooks, which also served as natural pits.\n\nCareful when climbing the seventy steps: the stairs are steep and almost ladder-like.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11405_Tour_Saint_Martin_3a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11405_Tour_Saint_Martin_3a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11405_Tour_Saint_Martin_4b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Office du tourisme d’Yvonand","name_2":null,"street":"Avenue du Temple 15","zip":"1462","place":"Yvonand","tel":"+41 24 430 22 02","fax":null,"email":"tourisme@yvonand.ch","url1_link":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch","x_coordinate":548104.9190012113,"y_coordinate":180698.32358750465,"change_date":null,"id":189,"r_key":189,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/P7345/st-martin-s-tower","touristic_region":9}}
