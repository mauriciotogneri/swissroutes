It consists of several, combinable loops and contains elements encouraging jumps. The track is suitable for children and experts alike.","description":"To our knowledge, this is the first concrete pump track in the world. It is located right in front of the schoolhouse. Thanks to the concrete the track is completely weatherproof but can get slippery when wet. However, it dries in just 30 minutes after which it is perfect for use again. The track is also suitable for inline skates etc.\n\nThe BMX-like, broad outer loop allows visitors to learn to jump and consequently is the most popular option on this pump track. The inner loop is narrower and therefore demands more concentration. The bends are less raised than, for example in Chur, which means very advanced riders can't ride through them as fast. For children, however, this difference is barely discernible.\n\nLength: 200m / area: 600m2 / wave and bend height: 30-120cm / Surface: concrete.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_2.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_13.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_4.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_5.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_11.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_6.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_7.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_9.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_8.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_10.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Jenaz_12.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Pr√§ttigau Marketing","name_2":null,"street":"Feldweg 19","zip":"7233","place":"Jenaz","tel":"+41 81 325 11","fax":null,"email":"info@praettigau.ch","url1_link":"https://www.praettigau.info","x_coordinate":773009.4956734502,"y_coordinate":200496.9084288702,"change_date":null,"id":702,"r_key":702,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.praettigau.info/en/attractions/pumptrack-jenaz","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
