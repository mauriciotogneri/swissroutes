        "abstract": "The Gelmerbahn funicular railway - with a gradient of 106% Europe's steepest - will take you to the Gelmersee lake (1,850 m above sea level) set in the midst of  magnificent, high mountains. Lake Gelmer will tempt you to linger a while and is the starting point for walks and hikes in the mountains.",
        "description": "Enjoy a thrilling time on Europe's steepest funicular railway. Nearly vertical in some places, the railway constructed in 1926 to aid the construction of the Gelmer dam will take you high up to Lake Gelmer. There's a lovely walk around the lake, suitable, however, only for sure-footed people. Various other great walks and mountain hikes start at the Gelmerbahn mountain station. But even an easy, relaxing trip is worth it time and again. The magnificent mountain world will bowl you over.",
