        "abstract": "300 Metres above Davos is an alpine garden, the «Alpinum Schatzalp» with over 5,000 different plant species from every mountain range in the world. This beautiful setting lends itself superbly to regular botanical events.",
        "description": "In this idyll is the historic Schatzalp hotel. One highlight is the wedding garden named after the German novelist, Thomas Mann. The alpinum is filled with different collections. There are new exhibits from all over the world next to long-established items - a gardener's paradise. The Alps, the Atlas range, the Caucasian mountains, the Himalaya and the Rocky Mountains, the list goes on and on.\n\nMost plants are in bloom in June and July. But even at the end of September a visit is well worthwhile. Plants are labeled both in German and Latin providing information about origin, healing properties or even poisons. So don't forget to take a reference book! This enchanting world lies at your feet after a few minutes walk along a level path from the Schatzalp mountain railway.",
