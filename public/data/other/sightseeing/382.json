        "abstract": "The Muri friary is one of the most important cultural monuments in the canton of Aargau. It was founded in 1027 and during the subsequent 800 years was expanded by the Benedictine monks to the size it is today.",
        "description": "The silhouette of the shimmering white domed church with its imposing roof pyramid and surrounded by needle spires of towers and roofs can be seen far and wide in the hilly landscape of the «Freiamt» district. In the church, the Roman crypts, Gothic high choir and Baroque central construction bear witness to the fact that the friary buildings represent a project covering centuries.\n\nAfter its founding in 1027 and long period of expansion the friary was closed in 1841: today the convent is based in Gries near Bolzano/South Tyrol. Today however, the friary church still remains a place of worship, culture and music with its total of five organs, the Bettagskonzert (concert for the day of prayer) and the series of concerts entitled «Music in the Muri Friary Church».\n\nThe friary church, the cloister with its Renaissance glass paintings, the friary museum and world famous organ system is an invitation to a visit which will certainly be worthwhile.",
