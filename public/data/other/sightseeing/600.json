The reddened stones of this historical monument immerse visitors in the 11th century, the epoch when Cluny monks built the third church based on the model of the church in Cluny. This jewel of Romanesque art underwent several transformations in later times.\n\nThe interior of the abbey church contains superb mural colour paintings of the beginning of the 14th century. The 8th century ambo located in the pre-chancel is the only witness of the second church. This place tells one thousand and five hundred years of history and offers moments for meditation or sacred music concerts all year round. Maison du Prieur, which was built in the 13th century, is a legendary monastic building. It was built to receive the prominent hosts of the Father Superior. Various rooms still bear witness to this prestigious past. Today they serve as banqueting or reception rooms.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7996_Abteikirche-von-Romainmotier_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7996_Abteikirche-von-Romainmotier_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/7996_Abteikirche-von-Romainmotier_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Office du tourisme de Romainmôtier c/o La Porterie","name_2":null,"street":"Rue du Bourg 9","zip":"1323","place":"Romainmôtier","tel":"+41 (0)24 453 38 28","fax":null,"email":"tourisme@romainmotier.ch","url1_link":"https://www.romainmotier-tourisme.ch","x_coordinate":525254.1896331899,"y_coordinate":171830.48535349662,"change_date":null,"id":600,"r_key":600,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/P650/romainmotier-abbey-church","touristic_region":9}}
