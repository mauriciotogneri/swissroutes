Waves, jumps and steep face curves as well as natural passages with roots and loose forest soil provide variety. The trail is suitable for athletic people with biking experience.","description":"The almost four-kilometre climb to the start of the Rabenfluh trail is sweetened by several vantage points: the view from Gallishubel over the city, lake Thun and the Stockhorn mountain chain is simply magnificent. Those who make a short detour of some 100 metres will reach the Rabenfluh vantage point with a great view over Thun, which gives the trail its name. If you want to take it easy, you can use the shuttle bus to get to the starting point. \n\nAfter that, you will need to concentrate: from top to bottom, the Rabenfluh flow trail is replete with jumping and rolling waves and jumps. Immediately after the start, several steep face curves are lined up. Steep passages which provide for a good pace, alternate with narrow sections. In the so-called \"Manser\" section, the trail was left natural. Here you will find roots, loose forest soil as well as tight curves around trees and bushes. The builders of the trail used the old \"canyon\" in such a way that a real rollercoaster was created.\n\nEspecially in the middle part, the trail flows nicely as the curves are wider, but on the narrow forest path in the lowest part, quite a bit of skill is required. All in all, the trail is not suitable for beginners. But if you feel safe on single trails, you should be able to ride this trail without any problems. All the elements can also be rolled over. Advanced riders will always find new lines and combinations for jumping.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_01_min_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_01_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_02_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_03_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_04_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_05_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_06_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_07_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_08_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_10_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_12_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_13_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_14_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_15_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_16_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_17_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_18_min_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rabeflue_19_min_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_01_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_02_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_03_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_04_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_05_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_06_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_07_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_08_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_10_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_12_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_13_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_14_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_15_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_16_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_17_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_18_min_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rabeflue_19_min_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Bikepark Thunersee","name_2":null,"street":"Untere Tr√ºelmatt","zip":"3624","place":"Goldiwil","tel":"+41 (0)33 221 04 04","fax":null,"email":"marketing@bikepark-thunersee.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bikepark-thunersee.ch","x_coordinate":616038.3632454603,"y_coordinate":179331.28628252284,"change_date":null,"id":803,"r_key":803,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bikepark-thunersee.ch","touristic_region":6}}
