Wire ropes lead over the first buttress. These are quickly replaced with iron pins which you climb up on. After the junction of the first mid-descent, the lofty climb to the Vorderer Eggstock (2449m) follows, along the ridge to the suspension bridge and then on to the summit pasture on the Mittler Eggstock (2420m). Behind this is the descent or the last demanding climb with the key point on the Hinter Eggstock (2445m). Behind the Gumen mountain restaurant is the 200m long beginner and children’s’ climbing route.\n\nThe best times of year: June, after the snow has melted, until the end of autumn in late October.\n\nCompulsory equipment: climbing helmet, climbing harness or climbing combination, inspected climbing route set with 2 carabiners and anti-fall device.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_4817_2_g.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_4817_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_4911_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5086_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5114_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5446_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5656_2_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_4817_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_4911_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5086_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5114_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5446_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Klettersteig_Braunwald_MRH_DSC_5656_2_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","",""],"name":"VISIT Glarnerland AG, Gäste-Info Braunwald","name_2":null,"street":"Dorfstrasse 5","zip":"8784","place":"Braunwald","tel":"+41 55 645 03 03","fax":null,"email":"info@braunwald.ch","url1_link":"https://www.braunwald.ch","x_coordinate":717871.037476014,"y_coordinate":199769.0147133263,"change_date":null,"id":290,"r_key":290,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.klettersteige.ch","touristic_region":2,"canton":14}}
