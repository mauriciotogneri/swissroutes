        "description": "The museum’s permanent exhibition deals with culture, housing, lifestyle, beliefs and traditions in the Sense region during the 18th and 19th centuries. The aim is to preserve local traditions and culture for future generations while still promoting contemporary culture in the region.\n\nAlso on display are a collection of objects made by the straw industry, once a major economic player in the region, as well as fine examples of traditional Sensler dress.\n\nThe museum is in the heart of Tafers village, right beside the church of St Marin. The building, originally the village schoolhouse, dates back to 1780 and is a fine example of typical Sensler wooden architecture.",
