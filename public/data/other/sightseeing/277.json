Already in 1863 there was a modest convalescent home with six guest rooms above the great hall and a restaurant in the three rooms located in the central block.\n\nToday the fortress is privately owned and has been almost completely restored to its original condition. Enjoy a glass of local red wine in the fortress restaurant. You will have an outstanding view to the Swiss alps and over Stein am Rhein.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9081_Burg-Hohenklingen_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9081_Burg-Hohenklingen_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9081_Burg-Hohenklingen_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Schaffhauserland Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Vordergasse 73","zip":"8201","place":"Schaffhausen","tel":"+41 (0)52 632 40 20","fax":null,"email":"info@schaffhauserland.ch","url1_link":"https://www.schaffhauserland.ch","x_coordinate":706621.000625367,"y_coordinate":280540.00114085607,"change_date":null,"id":277,"r_key":277,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.burghohenklingen.ch","touristic_region":2}}
