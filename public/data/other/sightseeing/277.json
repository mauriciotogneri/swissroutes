        "abstract": "The Hohenklingen Fortress, an example of a medieval fortress built on a hill, is situated 590m above sea level,  overlooking the picturesque little town of Stein am Rhein on a Nagelfluh, (gompholite) summit, that runs in a west-east direction.",
        "description": "Its history presumably begins in the 11th century. Already in 1863 there was a modest convalescent home with six guest rooms above the great hall and a restaurant in the three rooms located in the central block.\n\nToday the fortress is privately owned and has been almost completely restored to its original condition. Enjoy a glass of local red wine in the fortress restaurant. You will have an outstanding view to the Swiss alps and over Stein am Rhein.",
