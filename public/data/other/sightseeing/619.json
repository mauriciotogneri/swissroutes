        "abstract": "In the past «Schweizer» or «Schweitzer» was synonymous with mercenary. Poverty and a deep longing for adventure drove the young Swiss men from their narrow valleys in the hands and service of foreign powers and onto European battlefields.",
        "description": "No other town has contributed more Swiss Gards to the Papal chair than Naters. For this reason the historian Werner Bellwald decided to open a museum of the Swiss Guards in the old fortress just above Naters. Since the present-day Swiss Army no longer needed the fortress, the town bought the storage halls for ammunition deep within the granite. Now the halls house the collection of the museum.\n\nOur tip: Take a round-trip with the ‘little Simplon-Express’ through Brig and Naters. Afterwards you will be chauffeured up to the Museum of the Swiss Guard.",
