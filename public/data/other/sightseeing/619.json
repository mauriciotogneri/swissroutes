Poverty and a deep longing for adventure drove the young Swiss men from their narrow valleys in the hands and service of foreign powers and onto European battlefields.","description":"No other town has contributed more Swiss Gards to the Papal chair than Naters. For this reason the historian Werner Bellwald decided to open a museum of the Swiss Guards in the old fortress just above Naters. Since the present-day Swiss Army no longer needed the fortress, the town bought the storage halls for ammunition deep within the granite. Now the halls house the collection of the museum.\n\nOur tip: Take a round-trip with the ‘little Simplon-Express’ through Brig and Naters. Afterwards you will be chauffeured up to the Museum of the Swiss Guard.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8017_Gardemuseum_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8017_Gardemuseum_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8017_Gardemuseum_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Blatten - Belalp Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Rischinustrasse  5","zip":"3914","place":"Blatten","tel":"+41 (0)27 921 60 40","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@belalp.ch","url1_link":"https://www.belalp.ch","x_coordinate":641596.0661861621,"y_coordinate":130990.03011230519,"change_date":null,"id":619,"r_key":619,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zentrumgarde.ch","touristic_region":11}}
