        "description": "Paths and trails in the unspoilt Jura countryside lead you to works of art, which, without exception, go hand-in-hand with nature. The centre is composed of the Romanesque abbey church with a gallery to host new and different exhibitions.\n\nIn this historical setting, rooms can be used for seminars, symposia and informal discussions. Here guests can reflect on the processes of change, far removed from the day’s events. Accommodation with an extraordinary atmosphere and an authentic abbey kitchen provides you with a quiet overnight stay and peaceful dreams.",
