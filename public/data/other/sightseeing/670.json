Not only will you see squirrels stirring in the tallest trees, but also men, women and children visiting the Gantrisch Rope Park.","description":"Seven certified courses await those daring enough to climb onto the platforms in Nature Park Gantrisch – some as high as 36 meters off the ground! Gantrisch Rope Park offers the highest platform in any Swiss rope park.\n\nThe children's course is separate from the main park. It includes 10 platforms ranging from 2 to 5 meters in height. Children first receive instructions then complete a practice course. Parents are allowed to supervise their little ones from the ground.\n\nGrilling sites, a forest adventure trail, a playground and a restaurant complete the range of options in Längeneybad.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Seilpark2_a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Seilpark2_a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/jSeipa-nah_b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Seilpark Gantrisch","name_2":null,"street":"Längeneybad","zip":"3154","place":"Rüschegg-Heuchbach","tel":"+41 (0)31 739 01 00","fax":null,"email":"info@seilpark-gantrisch.ch","url1_link":"https://www.seilpark-gantrisch.ch","x_coordinate":599312.9922347516,"y_coordinate":180667.41141452658,"change_date":null,"id":670,"r_key":670,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.seilpark-gantrisch.ch","touristic_region":6}}
