Parts of the nave, the choir as well as the smaller tower, date back to the time around 1100. The tower of the old church is overshadowed by its larger successor from the Late Gothic era.","description":"On entering the church, the visitor is greeted by a multitude of forms and colours. The painted ceiling dating from 1478, with its pointed arches and tracery, still adheres to the Gothic use of forms. The wall paintings, in contrast, originate from the Langobard Early Renaissance.\n\nThe larger church tower was hit by lightning in 1682. Its spire went up in flames and was not rebuilt as there had been a bell tower in the village since 1669. Nevertheless, the silhouette of San Gian has become a landmark for Celerina's.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7959_Kirche-San-Gian_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7959_Kirche-San-Gian_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7959_Kirche-San-Gian_3b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Celerina Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Plazza da la Staziun 8","zip":"7505","place":"Celerina","tel":"+41 (0)81 830 00 11","fax":null,"email":"celerina@engadin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.engadin.stmoritz.ch/celerina","x_coordinate":786549.1167449345,"y_coordinate":154238.4485108121,"change_date":null,"id":322,"r_key":322,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.stiegenzumhimmel.it/kulturstaetten-detail.php?id=47","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
