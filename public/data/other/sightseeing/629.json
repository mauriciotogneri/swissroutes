        "description": "The solar system has been reproduced on a smaller scale all the way along this path, that way, with every step forward, you will move a million kilometres forward through the cosmos. Without noticing it, you will move three times faster than the speed of light. Leaving from the sun, you travel a distance all the greater that the object is remote from the sun.\n\nWhilst stopping along this celestial path, you will learn about the planets’ dimensions , their characteristics and above all be able to discover and admire the beauty of one which is only a stone’s throw away – planet Earth. Beyond the simple enjoyment of fresh air and magnificent mountain scenery, we offer you a chance to approach in a more concrete way one of the most astonishing sciences : astronomy.",
