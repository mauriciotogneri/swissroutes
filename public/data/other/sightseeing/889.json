        "abstract": "From Grütschalp it is just under 3 km and 600 altitude meters to get to Lauterbrunnen – this trail is a real challenge for advanced riders. The downhill is steep, with tight turns, equipped with various obstacles, and the ground constantly changes.",
        "description": "The convenient cable car takes the mountain bikers to Grütschalp, the starting point of the trail. The Grütsch trail is steep, the turns are tight and there are many. Still, the track is incredibly fluid, and parts of it in the forest were left in its natural state. There are also a few gravel paths. The ground keeps changing - from dirt and dust to rocks, roots, 60 berms, drop jumps, and north-shore elements to navigate or jump. \n\nThe Swiss German word “Grütsch” indicates that the trail is located in a large landslide area. The erratic boulders in the lower part are proof of this. They presented an enormous challenge for the shaping crew. Since blasting was not an option, they simply built north-shore constructions across the rock piles.\n\nIf you’re hungry or thirsty after the ride, choose one of the restaurants with a nice terrace on the road through the village of Lauterbrunnen.\n\n\nLength: 2.97 km \nDuration: 16 minutes\nDifficulty: difficult\nGradient: 20%",
