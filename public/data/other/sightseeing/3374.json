The turquoise blue water and inviting temperature are simply irresistible. You could almost be in the Caribbean!","description":"With its turquoise green water and picturesque coves, Caumasee out-does so many beaches you will find in the Mediterranean. It is so aptly named, because the name means, «lake of the midday stillness». And, of course, this is precisely why visitors so appreciate it. After a good hike through the Flimser forest, a swim in the lake is all the more rewarding.\n\nAs part of its attraction, the lake offers a beach volleyball field, a large play area, pedal and rowing boats for the lake, as well as a restaurant.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_1_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_3_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_2_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_1_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_3_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_2_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_StrandbadCaumasee_1_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","",""],"name":"Strandbad Caumasee","name_2":null,"street":"-","zip":"7018","place":"Flims","tel":"+41 (0)81 911 11 33","fax":null,"email":"caumasee@laax.com","url1_link":"http://www.caumasee.ch","x_coordinate":741714.9240125595,"y_coordinate":187268.95064679938,"change_date":null,"id":3374,"r_key":3374,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.caumasee.ch","touristic_region":1}}
