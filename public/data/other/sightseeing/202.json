Enjoy the fantastic 360 degree panorama at 1,333 meters / 1,239 yards above sea-level. If you're feeling brave, you can travel back down the mountain by scooter.","description":"The hike up to the Hörnli is easy and does not pose any particular challenges. The path leads through the forest most of the way. Once you have arrived at the summit, you can enjoy the view of the wildly romantic Töss valley and the mountain panorama dominated by the Säntis. Take some refreshment on the sun terrace or in the mountain guesthouse, before tackling the return route down into the valley.\n\nIf you’re feeling adventurous, you can hire a scooter from the guesthouse and dash back down into the valley on it. Whether you take it at any easy pace or opt for a rapid descent, you are bound to enjoy having a chat on the scooter.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9161_Hoernli_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9161_Hoernli_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9161_Hoernli_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Berggasthaus","name_2":null,"street":"Hörnli","zip":"8496","place":"Steg","tel":"+41 (0)55 245 12 02","fax":null,"email":"info@berggasthaus-hoernli.ch","url1_link":"https://www.berggasthaus-hoernli.ch","x_coordinate":713529.6687119829,"y_coordinate":247760.4937300601,"change_date":null,"id":202,"r_key":202,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.berggasthaus-hoernli.ch","touristic_region":3}}
