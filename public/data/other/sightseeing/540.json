It is located in the Pre-Alps on the left-hand shore of Sarine river south of Château-d'Oex and covers 34 square kilometres of middle mountain landscapes. It stretches from the Gummfluh mountain chain to Pic Chaussy.\n\nLa Pierreuse is an area of national importance with typically pre-Alpine features: rocky areas, Alpine meadows presenting rich flora, moors, firs and deciduous woodland. This area also abounds in different bird species and, if you are patient enough, eagles, grouse and falcons.\r\nA one-day hike offering magnificent vistas starts out from the upper station of La Videmanette (Rougemont cable railway), goes around La Pierreuse and crosses four mountain passes before arriving at L’Etivaz.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8428_Pro-Natura-Reservat-La-Pierreuse_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8428_Pro-Natura-Reservat-La-Pierreuse_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8428_Pro-Natura-Reservat-La-Pierreuse_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Pays-d'Enhaut Tourisme","name_2":null,"street":"Place du Village 6","zip":"1660","place":"Château-d'Oex","tel":"+41 (0)26 924 25 25","fax":null,"email":"info@chateau-doex.ch","url1_link":"https://www.chateau-doex.ch","x_coordinate":579796.3142929329,"y_coordinate":141057.3874846591,"change_date":null,"id":540,"r_key":540,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.region-du-leman.ch/en/P540/la-pierreuse-nature-reserve","touristic_region":9}}
