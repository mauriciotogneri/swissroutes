It is located on the Wasen, between Ernen, a wonderfull village of the valley of Goms in Valais and Ausserbinn. In 2007, integrated between the red firs and the moss-filled boulders, an adventure trail was built by the non-profit Zauberwald Fondation. On the almost 20 posts the children can play with nature and let their fantasy take over. Barbecue pits, tables/benches and drinking water allows you to linger.\n\nThe story of Brüna is also available as a children's book (in german) and a CD (german/french/italian). It is Andreas Weissen's first children's book. He is a famous Oberwalliser legend narrator. It is illustrated by Pauline Rey.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Zauberwald_Ernen_2a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Zauberwald_Ernen_2a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Zauberwald_Ernen_1b.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Ausgang_Baumstamm_2.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Baumhaus_3.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Im_Kobel_2.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Kinderspielplatz_Zauberwald.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Rennen_auf_Baumstamm_hoch_form.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Schreiben_an_Schorsch.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11340_Ernen_Zauberwald_Seilziehen_2.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Zauberwald Ernen","name_2":null,"street":"Hengert 17","zip":"3995","place":"Ernen","tel":"+41 (0)27 971 17 42","fax":null,"email":"ernen@landschaftspark-binntal.ch","url1_link":"https://www.zauberwaldernen.ch","x_coordinate":653120.2519586848,"y_coordinate":137350.24781541456,"change_date":null,"id":163,"r_key":163,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zauberwaldernen.ch","touristic_region":11}}
