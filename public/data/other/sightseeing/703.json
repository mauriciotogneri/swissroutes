Learn to perfectly control your bike in tight bends and over waves and put your new skills to the test on your next mountain bike tour!","description":"The Pump Track Cuntschett is located in the immediate vicinity of the Pontresina railway station and is easily accessible by bike or on foot in a few minutes. The pump track offers perfect routes for beginners, ambitious enthusiasts and bike whizzes alike. Even skaters and, in winter, cross-country skiers find perfect bends, dips and waves at the track.\n\nPontresina’s pump track is suitable for riders of all ages and offers countless riding options over a total length of 350m. The concrete pump track can be used daily from May to October. When there’s snow some of the bends and dips are prepared for cross-country skiers, which means bike riders and skaters can’t use the pump track. No spe-cial skills required. Bikes and protective gear are available for hire from the Pontresina Sports bike shop.\n\nLength: 350 metre \narea: 1200m2 \nsurface: concrete.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_6.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_7.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_9.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_8.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_6.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_10.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_4.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_Pontresina_5.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Pontresina Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Via Maistra 133","zip":"7504","place":"Pontresina","tel":"+41 (0)81 838 83 00","fax":null,"email":"pontresina@engadin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.engadin.ch","x_coordinate":788734.9743900063,"y_coordinate":151844.21020882734,"change_date":null,"id":703,"r_key":703,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.engadin.ch/en/activities/mountainbike-pumptrack-cuntschett-en/","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
