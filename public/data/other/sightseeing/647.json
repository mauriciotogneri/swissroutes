From the Bernese Oberland and Central Switzerland aspect however, the Grimsel-Gries route played an important role in the transport of Sbrinz, a cheese produced in the east of the Bernese Oberland and Central Switzerland and much in demand in Northern Italy.\n\nThe topographically difficult route presented rather a challenge in terms of construction technology. This is particularly illustrated by the fact that the danger of avalanches and landslides made it impossible to avoid bridging the River Aare several times. The two Bögelisbrüggli (arched bridges) are prime examples of bridge-building skills. The Hasli region was responsible for the maintenance of the entire route network, however, the revenue from tolls collected at Ägerstein was insufficient and the Bernese authorities continually had to provide subsidies.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/IVS_40_Boeglisbrueggli.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/IVS_40_Boeglisbrueggli.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20110803_VS_Obergoms_AlterSaumwegGletsch_Grimsel_COJ_10.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20110803_VS_Obergoms_AlterSaumwegGletsch_Grimsel_COJ_11.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20110803_VS_Obergoms_AlterSaumwegGletschGrimsel_COJ_14.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/20110803_VS_Obergoms_AlterSaumwegGletschGrimsel_COJ_6.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/_Wallis_Grimselpass_Obergesteln_Grimselweg_Schrackzaun_FRB.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/_Wallis_Grimsel_Fahrstrasse_Tonenden_1.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","",""],"name":"Bundesinventar der historischen Verkehrswege der Schweiz (IVS)","name_2":null,"street":" ","zip":" ","place":" ","tel":" ","fax":null,"email":" ","url1_link":"https://www.ivs.admin.ch","x_coordinate":667629.883499306,"y_coordinate":161010.51035271506,"change_date":null,"id":647,"r_key":647,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://s.geo.admin.ch/6fb1636873","touristic_region":6}}
