        "description": "The Vindonissa Museum was opened in 1912 and soon became an international model for Roman museums. The permanent exhibition offers visitors the opportunity to explore the key finds and knowledge gained from more than 100 years of excavations. Listen to the stories from the era of the Romans, marvel at the archaeological findings or try on the legionnaires' equipment yourself.\n\nIn addition to exploring on your own the Vindonissa Museum also offers numerous guided tours focusing on various themes. Gain an insight into the Roman intelligence services, learn how the conquest strategies of that time differ from those today, or find out how the supplies to the 6000 legionnaires were secured.\n\nBrugg offers the opportunity for young and old to follow in the tracks of the Romans and learn about various aspects of their day-to-day lives.",
