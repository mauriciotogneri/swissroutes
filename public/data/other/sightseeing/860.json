Right next to the pump track is a concrete skate park with a bowl and a street area.\n\n\nSurface: asphalt\nArea: 390m2","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_2_M.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_1_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_3_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_1_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Escape-St-Marc_3_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["Verbier Promotion","Verbier Promotion","Verbier Promotion"],"photo_gallery_author":["upzairaerial.ch","upzairaerial.ch","upzairaerial.ch"],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","",""],"name":"Promobike Verbier/St-Bernard","name_2":null,"street":"CP 300","zip":"1936","place":"Verbier","tel":"+41 (0)27 775 25 11","fax":null,"email":"info@verbierbikepark.ch","url1_link":"https://www.verbierbikepark.ch","x_coordinate":582965.0049864836,"y_coordinate":102810.89972949804,"change_date":null,"id":860,"r_key":860,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.valais.ch/en/activities/mountain-bike/pumptracks","touristic_region":11,"canton":7}}
