It was the first zoological garden in Switzerland, and is one of the most interesting and attractive zoos in Europe.","description":"The «Zolli» is home to a considerable number of well cared-for indigenous and exotic animals in an appropriately park-like setting. Many animals have indoor and outdoor enclosures, and there are several excellent themed houses such as the Vivarium, the Ape House, the Bird House and the Etoscha House, which explains life in the African savannah.\n\nSome 6'000 animals (belonging to 600 species) live here, and nearly a million people visit the Zolli every year. This makes it the most frequently visited attraction in Switzerland after the Rhine Falls at Schaffhausen.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8189_Basler-Zoo_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8189_Basler-Zoo_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8189_Basler-Zoo_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Basel Tourismus Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Steinenberg 14","zip":"4010","place":"Basel","tel":"+41 (0)61 268 68 68","fax":null,"email":"info@basel.com","url1_link":"https://www.basel.com","x_coordinate":610785.7105644069,"y_coordinate":266487.5363904972,"change_date":null,"id":573,"r_key":573,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zoobasel.ch/index.php?PHPSESSID=de639f50b4952146e10a547d564518a6","touristic_region":5}}
