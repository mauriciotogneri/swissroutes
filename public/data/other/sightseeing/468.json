In the 17th century, the millers of Le Locle hewed out the cave at the Col-des-Roches in order to be able to utilize the energy of the subterranean waterfall. They installed five water wheels which powered the mills, the threshing machines, and the sawmills.","description":"The tour takes the visitors inside the mountain to these fabulous subterranean mills. A mythical descent to a depth of 23 meters below ground. This exceptional trip into the rock cave reveals the water mills with their factory, in operation between the 17th and the 19th century, bearing witness to the inventive genius of the local inhabitants at that time. They had to overcome numerous obstacles in order to be able to construct a factory below ground and utilize the natural resources for their sustentation.\n\nA visit of the museum on the topics of energy, mills, grain, and the local history rounds off the tour.\n\nThe temperature inside the cave is 7°C. Wear warm clothing and sturdy shoes.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11598_Unterirdische_Muehlen_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_1_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_6_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_11_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_12_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11598_Unterirdische_Muehlen_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11598_Unterirdische_Muehlen_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_1_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_6_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_11_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Die_unterirdischen_Muehlen_von_Le_Col_des_Roches_GPerret_MoulinsSouterrains_12_g.jpg","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["© Guillaume Perret // www.guillaumeperret.com","© Guillaume Perret // www.guillaumeperret.com","© Guillaume Perret // www.guillaumeperret.com","© Guillaume Perret // www.guillaumeperret.com","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","",""],"name":"Tourisme Neuchâtelois","name_2":null,"street":"Hôtel des Postes","zip":"2000","place":"Neuchâtel","tel":"+41 (0)32 889 68 90","fax":null,"email":"info@ne.ch","url1_link":"https://www.neuchateltourisme.ch","x_coordinate":545523.0571219721,"y_coordinate":211114.24624415152,"change_date":null,"id":468,"r_key":468,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.lesmoulins.ch","touristic_region":8}}
