Directly above the border river that is the Rhine, you can find Lustenau, the attractive village in Vorarlberg (A).\n\nThe Heldsberg artillery and casemate facility was planned in 1938 after Germany annexed the neighbouring country of Austria on 12 March 1938. The fortressâ€™s role was to prevent a crossing over the Rhine border river between Montlingen and Lake Constance and to disrupt any movements across the lake from the Lindau area, thus defending Switzerland from an invasion.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9067_Festungsmuseum-Heldsberg_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9067_Festungsmuseum-Heldsberg_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9067_Festungsmuseum-Heldsberg_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Festungsmuseum Heldsberg","name_2":null,"street":"Obere Heldsbergstrasse 5","zip":"9430","place":"St. Margrethen","tel":"+41 (0)71 733 40 31","fax":null,"email":"info@festung.ch","url1_link":"https://www.festung.ch","x_coordinate":766270.6404402099,"y_coordinate":257074.5417156892,"change_date":null,"id":442,"r_key":442,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.festung.ch","touristic_region":2}}
