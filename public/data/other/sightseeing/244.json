Its basement presents a profile of the Winkelrieds of Nidwalden. The second floor looks at the themes of faith and customs from childbirth to the deathbed, from peasant wear to the amulets worn to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThe Swiss Army commandeered Castle Fürigen in World War Two, finally relinquishing it in 1987. A majority of its rooms and furnishings originate from the era of the castle’s building, thus providing comprehensive insights into the workings of a historic Swiss castle. Visitor can see for themselves how the officers and men went about their business amongst the narrow passages and numerous rooms hewn into the rock of Mt. Bürgenstock.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8198_Nidwaldner-Museum_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8198_Nidwaldner-Museum_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8198_Nidwaldner-Museum_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Nidwalden Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 1045","zip":"6371","place":"Stans","tel":"+41 (0)41 610 88 33","fax":null,"email":"info@nidwalden.com","url1_link":"https://www.nidwalden.com","x_coordinate":670741.9767402789,"y_coordinate":200937.2863523795,"change_date":null,"id":244,"r_key":244,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.nidwaldner-museum.ch","touristic_region":4}}
