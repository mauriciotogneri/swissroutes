        "description": "The Flow Trail on the Corviglia in St. Moritz is unique and can be compared with a flowing downhill pump track who has been harmoniously integrated into the surrounding landscape. Flow and fun are the key factors when using the trail. It leads from Corviglia (top station) via Sass Runzöl and Alp Nova down to Chantarella (middle station).\n\nThe attractive flow trail is not just something to be tackled by proficient bikers – families will love it, too. Flow trail fans can use the Corviglia mountain transport systems to transport their bike from St. Moritz Dorf to Corviglia. The new flow trail is perfect as a warm-up exercise before undertaking a more extensive tour or as a spectacular finish to one of the numerous mountain bike tours on the Corviglia. And it's not uncommon for riders to ride the flow trail several times in succession.\n\nLength: 3,7 km / difference in altitude going down: 480m / starting point: Corviglia, top station.",
