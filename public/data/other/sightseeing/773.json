Advanced bikers can practice jumps while the less trained children can improve their skills while taking steep turns. Thanks to the tarmac the track dries quickly after rain.\n\nNote: During the big events on the sports ground «Ochsenbühl» only a part of the pump track will be accessible as the obstacles will be removed!","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-0_teaser.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-0_teaser.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-4.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-5.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/pumptrack-arosa-6.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","",""],"name":"Arosa Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Poststrasse","zip":"7050","place":"Arosa","tel":"+41 81 378 70 20","fax":null,"email":"arosa@arosa.swiss","url1_link":"https://arosalenzerheide.swiss","x_coordinate":771325.9973643908,"y_coordinate":183637.16516467743,"change_date":null,"id":773,"r_key":773,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://arosalenzerheide.swiss/de/Arosa","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
