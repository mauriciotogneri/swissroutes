        "description": "Just a few metres from Aarau Railway Station is the Aargauer Kunsthaus which was opened in 1959 and expanded in 2003 by the architects Herzog & de Meuron. On a site covering approx. 3000 m², the focus of attention is placed not only on the comprehensive collection of Swiss art but in particular also on young painters and artists from the region.\n\nFollow the history of Swiss art in the Aargauer Kunsthaus. Starting with works by Caspar Wolf, Johann Heinrich Füsseli and Arnold Böcklin, through to the 19th Century landscapes, the early modern and abstract art of the post-war period, through to the present day, the collection gives you a representative overview of the last 300 years. Exhibitions and events provide regular presentations primarily of the contemporary part of the collection, with a new focus, keeping the view of the collection alive.",
