From blue to black – there is something for everyone. Equally as breath-taking are the views of the surrounding 4000 meter peaks.  ","description":"Whether beginner or pro, the Verbier bike park offers plenty of thrills. Between Les Fontanets (2475 m) and Verbier (1535 m), you can choose between blue flow trails, intermediate red and challenging black trails, one with 65 jumps. The two blue trails are named “Tsopu” and “Chôtatai”. The latter is for those who prefer a particularly long downhill ride. With a length of 5 km it is the longest downhill in the bike park. Both are flow trails and they are fun and easy.\n\nThere are four red intermediate trails. Two lead across open terrain (freeride) and are equipped with wooden elements (North Shore features); “Tû çuci” additionally has jump elements. The “Bortabitche” trail is flowier, while “Wouaïy” leads through the forest. Watch out, it is more difficult when the ground is wet. And let’s not forget “Rôdze” - with 65 jumps it is probably the most recognised downhill track. It meanders through amazing scenery with views from the Combins massif all the way to the Dents du Midi. \n\nAdvanced riders will try the two black trails, either the official competition trail “Tire’s fire” or the natural and technical “Woooohhh”.
