It is home to a world-renowned collection of musical exhibits dating back over three centuries that are a real delight for the senses. A one-hour guided tour gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in the world of mechanical music automatons: high-precision Swiss music boxes, mechanical figures, orchestrions, dance-hall and fairground organs, and the huge automatic Britannic Organ from the ocean liner that was the sister ship of the Titanic – all these exhibits offer you a very special (and highly sonorous) museum experience.\n\nThe museum shop has a host of tempting items in store for you, and the restaurant with its panoramic terrace offers something for every taste. What's more, a visit to this museum can be combined ideally with an outing into its beautiful natural surroundings.\n\nThe «Seewen, Musikautomaten» PostBus stop and the parking area for cars and buses are located directly adjacent to the museum. Wheelchair access is provided throughout.\nThe museum can only be visited on a guided tour; please note the times of tours.","highlights":"","foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/07_MMA_Ausschnitt_aus_Musikdose_mit_Walze_und_Tonkamm_2013_500px.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/01_MMA_Nordfassade_des_Museums_im_Sommer_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/02_MMA_Eingang_des_Museums_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/03_MMA_Museumseingang_und_Foyer_mit_grossen_Orgeln_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/04_MMA_Salon_Bleu_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/05_MMA_Britannic_Orgel_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/06_MMA_Figurenautomat_Paar_auf_Parkbank_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/07_MMA_Ausschnitt_aus_Musikdose_mit_Walze_und_Tonkamm_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/08_MMA_Ausschnitt_aus_Tanzorgel_Decap_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/09_MMA_Zauberklang_Rundgang_2013_500px.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/10_MMA_Museumsrestaurant_mit_Aussichtsterrasse_2013_500px.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Museum für Musikautomaten Seewen SO","name_2":null,"street":"Bollhübel 1","zip":"4206","place":"Seewen SO","tel":"+41 (0)61 915 98 80","fax":null,"email":"musikautomaten@bak.admin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.musikautomaten.ch","x_coordinate":616838.4254670242,"y_coordinate":254420.07126869773,"change_date":null,"id":688,"r_key":688,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.musikautomaten.ch","touristic_region":5,"canton":16}}
