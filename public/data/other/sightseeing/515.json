Its builder was Prince-Bishop Heinrich von Thun. As protection for the expensive bridge, he established the fortified town of Kleinbasel on the right bank of the Rhine.","description":"The bridge initially served mainly local traffic, but in the 14th century, when the road over the St. Gotthard pass attained international significance, it became an important Rhine crossing for long-distance trade. After the introduction of the electric tram, it became necessary to replace the old bridge with today’s Mittlere Brücke dating from 1905. A copy of the old bridge chapel, the «Käppelijoch», where – among other things – death sentences used to be carried out in the Middle Ages, still reminds us of the original structure.\n\nToday, there is a landing stage at the Schifflände for the cruise vessels of the Basler Personenschiffahrt, which offers interesting excursions on the Rhine.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8234_Mittlere-Bruecke-und-Schifflaende_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8234_Mittlere-Bruecke-und-Schifflaende_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8234_Mittlere-Bruecke-und-Schifflaende_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Basel Tourismus Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Steinenberg 14","zip":"4010","place":"Basel","tel":"+41 (0)61 268 68 68","fax":null,"email":"info@basel.com","url1_link":"https://www.basel.com","x_coordinate":611289.3357658428,"y_coordinate":267668.18554815,"change_date":null,"id":515,"r_key":515,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.basel.com/de/Media/Attraktionen/Sehenswuerdigkeiten/Mittlere-Bruecke","touristic_region":5,"canton":8}}
