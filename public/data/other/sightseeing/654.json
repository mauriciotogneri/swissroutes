        "description": "The section from Lausanne to Pontarlier is part of the Roman road from Milan to Strassburg. In the Early Middle Ages, the route from Pontarlier via Romainmôtier to Aosta was mainly used by pilgrims. Romainmôtier, a traditional market town, has retained its picturesque charm, demonstrated by the fountain dating from 1887 and the stone gateway leading to the abbey.\n\nThe link from Yverdon to Les Fourgs was also in use in Roman times. However, traces of cart tracks left in the rocky ground between Vuiteboeuf and Sainte-Croix point to no earlier than the Early Middle Ages. The around 30 grooves in the rock slope come from various generations of use. In some places, steps that eased the work of the draught animals are visible below the grooves.",
