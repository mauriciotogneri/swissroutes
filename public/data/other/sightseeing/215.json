Lake Zürich lies on the route taken by the St. James pilgrims, who also visited Rapperswil on their way to Santiago de Compostela. A flimsy, twisting wooden walkway with loose boards led across the lake.\n\nSince the 19th century, a vehicle embankment has linked Rapperswil and Hurden at the narrowest point. Now the wooden bridge has been reconstructed. The 841-meter / 919.7-yard modern wooden bridge was opened in 2001 to replace the old walkway. The landscape from the bridge is breathtaking. You feel as if you are walking on the lake while being linked to both banks. The pilgrims’ halt on the Rapperswiler side of the lake is a great venue for relaxing and picnicking.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9251_Holzbruecke-Rapperswil---Hurden_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9251_Holzbruecke-Rapperswil---Hurden_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9251_Holzbruecke-Rapperswil---Hurden_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Rapperswil Zürichsee Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Fischmarktplatz 1","zip":"8640","place":"Rapperswil","tel":"+41 (0)55 225 77 00","fax":null,"email":"zuerichsee@zuerich.com","url1_link":"https://www.zuerich.com","x_coordinate":704099.1772234554,"y_coordinate":230932.2577905088,"change_date":null,"id":215,"r_key":215,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zuerichsee.ch/en/page.cfm/SightsRZ/LandmarkRZ/1090","touristic_region":3,"canton":23}}
