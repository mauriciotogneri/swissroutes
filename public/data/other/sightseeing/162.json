Milking, collecting and processing - the milk is turned into yoghurt, cream or butter almost at\nthe speed of light.\nThe products are already available in the shops in Gluringen or being served up for breakfast by local hoteliers the next day.\n\nHowever, the cheese specialities «Bio-Gomser 11» and «Baschi-Chääs» take a little longer. They need a little TLC. Made using old methods and recipes, the two raw milk specialities spend several weeks maturing in a cellar in Gluringen.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11397_Bio_Bergkaeserei_Goms_1a1.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11397_Bio_Bergkaeserei_Goms_1a1.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11397_Bio_Bergkaeserei_Goms_2b1.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Obergoms Tourismus AG","name_2":null,"street":"Furkastrasse 53","zip":"3985","place":"Münster","tel":"+41 (0)27 974 68 68","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@obergoms.ch","url1_link":"https://www.obergoms.ch","x_coordinate":660879.7438885062,"y_coordinate":146250.45366150374,"change_date":null,"id":162,"r_key":162,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.biobergkaese.ch","touristic_region":11}}
