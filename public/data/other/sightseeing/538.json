The «Roman Bridge» with two arches in Lavertezzo, the village of Corippo - national monument of architectural heritage, and the Verzasca dam, one of the highest dams in Europe.","description":"This bridge, in the village of Lavertezzo, is a popular destination of lovers in the Verzasca Valley. It is sometimes wrongly called the «Roman Bridge», since its architecture with two arches only goes back as far as the Romantic period in the seventeenth century. This stunning bridge is the starting point for various signposted walks that are not really strenuous, but still offer highly stimulating and beautiful views and landscapes. There are routes immersed in green that are suitable for energetic walkers and also routes that are ideal for families, small children and those who are less fit. Lavertezzo is also a favourite destination for bathers and divers. The signs of the past, such as this romantic bridge, other the castle, the mills, and the churches compare and contrast with the present-day structures, such as the dam across the Verzasca Valley, amidst a unique, evocative landscape.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8153_Ponte-dei-Salti-a-Lavertezzo_2a1.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8153_Ponte-dei-Salti-a-Lavertezzo_2a1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8153_Ponte-dei-Salti-a-Lavertezzo_1b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Ascona-Locarno Turismo","name_2":null,"street":"Via Brere 3a","zip":"6598","place":"Tenero","tel":"+41 (0)848 091 091","fax":null,"email":"tenero@ascona-locarno.com","url1_link":"https://www.ascona-locarno.com","x_coordinate":707714.0926946293,"y_coordinate":124121.94439264531,"change_date":null,"id":538,"r_key":538,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.ascona-locarno.com/en/commons/details/Ponte-dei-salti/2707.html","touristic_region":12,"canton":19}}
