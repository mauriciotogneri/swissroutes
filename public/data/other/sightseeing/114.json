Switzerland’s largest contiguous raised mire is located in the high valley near Rothenthurm. Large amounts of peat were cut there in the past.","description":"December 6th 1987 was a memorable day for mire protection. It is the day on which the Swiss people approved the adoption of the Rothenthurm Initiative by referendum. This not only prevented the construction of a planned military range on the mire, but also resulted in mire protection being enshrined in the Swiss Constitution.\n\nSwitzerland’s largest contiguous raised mire can be found in Rothenthurm. Different stages of mire development can be observed here. Large blanket mires, in which all blanket mire communities can be found, extend from around the raised mire and on the slopes of the Hochtal valley.\n\nMany of the raised mire areas that were dug up in the 20th century are gradually being regenerated thanks to the measures introduced under the initiative, for example the filling in of existing drainage trenches. Traces of peat cutting can still be seen in other places.\n\nThe traditional use of blanket mires as litter meadows is being continued to conserve the ecological quality of the landscape.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260085_2__g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260067_2__s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260085_2__s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260137_2__s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260177_2__s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260215_2__s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260067_2__g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260085_2__g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260137_2__g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260177_2__g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rothenthurm_P5260215_2__g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","",""],"name":"Bundesamt für Umwelt","name_2":null,"street":"und Naturdenkmäler von nationaler Bedeutung (BLN)","zip":"BLN-Objekt-Nr.","place":"1308","tel":"-","fax":null,"email":"bln@bafu.admin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bln","x_coordinate":694699.0100659842,"y_coordinate":221316.06461868208,"change_date":null,"id":114,"r_key":114,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bln","touristic_region":4}}
