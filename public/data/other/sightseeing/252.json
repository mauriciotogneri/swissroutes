For many decades it remained a well-kept secret and was always ready for battle.","description":"The fortress was opened to the public in 1998, enabling you to discover the caverns, ammunition depots, tunnels, casemates and artillery stands on a guided tour. The existence of the Swiss alpine fortress (called \"RÃ©duit\") became known sixty years ago. In bunker after bunker from Lake Geneva to Lake Constance, cannons, tank barriers and entire hospitals were hidden behind ingenious camouflages. Only a select few have ever entered the secret fortress.\n\nBut now the past has been brought to life in Vitznau. You can visit the once top-secret Vitznau Fortress, which is open all year round, as well as the original Fortress Hotel.\n\nGuided tours: Militiamen from the Swiss Army, either retired or still serving actively, will disclose the secrets of the Vitznau Fortress to you. Some 500 meters of tunnels, gigantic ammunition depots, cannons, a power station, an operating room, workshops, a small \"hotel\" and much more await you.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9323_Festung-Vitznau_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9323_Festung-Vitznau_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9323_Festung-Vitznau_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Luzern Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofstrasse 3","zip":"6002","place":"Luzern","tel":"+41 41 227 17 17","fax":null,"email":"luzern@luzern.com","url1_link":"https://www.luzern.com","x_coordinate":679921.1157699331,"y_coordinate":207030.1551595739,"change_date":null,"id":252,"r_key":252,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.wvrt.ch/en/navpage.cfm?category=ExcursionsWVR&subcat=MuseumWVR&id=49187","touristic_region":4,"canton":15}}
