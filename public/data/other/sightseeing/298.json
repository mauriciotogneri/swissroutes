It is a rock window that is 17m tall and 19m wide, located at some 2600m above sea level in the large Tschingelhorn mountain.","description":"Twice every year (on 13 or 14 March and 30 September or 1 October) the suns shines through the Martinsloch shortly before it sets, directly on to the Elm church. A set intervals, the moon can also be seen through the Martinsloch.\n\nThe Martinsloch forms part of the Tectonic Arena Sardona UNESCO natural heritage site. The mountain landscape between Vorderrheintal, Sernftal and Walensee is the only one of its kind in the world, as the processes that formed the mountains are particularly visible here. As a result of this unique characteristic, the 300km2 area was added to this list of UNESCO world heritage sites on 7 July 2008.\n\nQualified Geopark guides are happy to accompany you on a walk through the UNESCO site area and provide interesting information of the geology, agriculture, local features, fauna, flora and our splendid panoramic views.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9071_Martinsloch-Elm_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9071_Martinsloch-Elm_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9071_Martinsloch-Elm_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Elm Ferienregion","name_2":null,"street":"Obmoos","zip":"8767","place":"Elm","tel":"+41 (0)55 642 52 52","fax":null,"email":"info@elm.ch","url1_link":"https://www.elm.ch","x_coordinate":735918.7555283033,"y_coordinate":195814.60861265738,"change_date":null,"id":298,"r_key":298,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.elm.ch/winter/nav-main/natur-kultur/martinsloch.html","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
