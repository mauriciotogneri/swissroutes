        "description": "After visiting the Niagara Falls on a trip to America, Christian Pitschen Melchior was inspired to also make a tourist attraction out of a waterfall in his own country.\n\nThus with arduous manual labour he chiselled and blasted what remains to this day a virtually unchanged gallery preserved in the hard rock. This gallery leads to an impressive waterfall and then actually right underneath the Rhine to its other side.\n\nAt the entrance to Roffla Gorge there is a historic inn with a restaurant and a small museum that documents the fascinating history of the rock gallery.",
