These nine iron eminences cheerfully converse with one another like the mimes, actors and dancers once did on the stage at this exact spot.\n\nWith this fountain the popular artist endowed Basel with a new landmark. Regardless of the weather, the fountain site is always thronged with people being animated to picnic or moved to strike up a conversation with a stranger. This work of art has become part of the life of Baselâ€™s inhabitants in a way few other objects have.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8177_Tinguely-Brunnen_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8177_Tinguely-Brunnen_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8177_Tinguely-Brunnen_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Basel Tourismus, Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Steinenberg 14","zip":"4010","place":"Basel","tel":"+41 (0)61 268 68 68","fax":null,"email":"info@basel.com","url1_link":"https://www.basel.com","x_coordinate":611429.0989823075,"y_coordinate":267003.54308565415,"change_date":null,"id":567,"r_key":567,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.brunnenfuehrer.ch/brunnen/fasnacht.htm","touristic_region":5,"canton":8}}
