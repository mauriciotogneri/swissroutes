        "abstract": "St. Peter in Mistail is one of the oldest religious buildings in Switzerland. The present church was built around 800 AD and belonged to a monastery complex that by 1154 had already been abolished.",
        "description": "Alvaschein is the first village on the upper exit of the Schyn Gorge. It stands in an elevated position on a hill top. St Peter's monastery formerly lay below in a forest clearing at the edge of the gorge. This place still bears the Romansh name «Mistail». The 8th century church is all that remains of the Carolingian monastery.\n\nThe interior was completely decorated in Carolingian times. However, unlike Müstair, only small fragments of the Carolingian wall paintings have been preserved here. Being more robust, the Gothic frescoes were better able to withstand deterioration. In addition to a completely decorated central apse, a portrayal of St Christopher has also been preserved. The giant – the patron saint of travellers – is about four metres tall here.",
