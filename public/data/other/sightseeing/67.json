        "description": "The Cathedral of Saint Pierre was constructed between 1160 and 1232. Originally built in the Romanesque style, its arches were later extended into a Gothic style. In the 18th century, with the revival, at the time, of the architecture of the antiquity, a facade with Greco-Roman columns and a cupola inspired by Rome’s Pantheon were added. Since the Reformation, this majestic building has been used for Protestant religious services. You will see \"Calvin’s chair”, the sculpted stalls of the chancel, a monument and statue honouring the Duke of Rohan, who acted as the leader of the French Protestants under Henri IV and Louis XIII, and whose remains rest in the cathedral.\n\nUnder the cathedral, you can visit one of Europe’s largest subterranean archaeological sites. Here you will discover the foundations of former religious buildings.",
