The 170 m² large net structure – the Spiderweb – where people may balance and climb above the roaring River Lütschine provides an extra thrill.","description":"The Lower Grindelwald Glacier Canyon is an impressive masterpiece of nature. The canyon, which was once covered by glacier ice, can be reached through rock galleries and tunnels and is a popular destination. Walking, listening, looking and sensing constitute unique experiences in the glacier canyon. The roaring River Lütschine, the reflections of light along the steep walls, the changing temperatures and the cool winds stimulate the senses in a very special way.\n\nThe newly staged tourist attraction has been divided into six theme worlds: Familiarisation, genesis, geology, water, glacier and mysticism. A trip to the canyon is an experience for both young and old. The glacier canyon is an ideal easy-to-reach destination – also for short trips – and is accessible in all weathers. Visits are suitable for pedestrians of all ages.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_Gletschschlucht_Grindelwald_2a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_Gletschschlucht_Grindelwald_2a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_Gletschschlucht_Grindelwald_1b.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_attraktion_gletscherschlucht_3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_5.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_6.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_7.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_8.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_9.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_11.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_12.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_grindelwald_attraktion_10.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_grindelwald1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_grindelwald.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_gletscherschlucht_grindelwald_licht_spiderweb_4.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11527_attraktion_gletscherschlucht_2.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Grindelwald Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Dorfstrasse 110","zip":"3818","place":"Grindelwald","tel":"+41 33 854 12 12","fax":null,"email":"info@grindelwald.swiss","url1_link":"https://www.grindelwald.swiss","x_coordinate":646729.6568573622,"y_coordinate":162600.5476011615,"change_date":null,"id":74,"r_key":74,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.gletscherschlucht.com","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
