        "description": "The farm and museum of Charbonnières displays a collection of historical objects connected to Vacherin Mont-d’Or cheesemaking. They were collected by an authentic Vacherin cheese refiner, who also recalls the history of this cheese. Vacherin Mont-d’Or started to be elaborated at the beginning of the 19th century in Joux Valley. It was only produced in winter and was marketed by Les Charbonnières, a village on the lakeshore of Lake Brenet opposite Dent de Vaulion. In 2003, it received a \"controlled origin appellation”, which guarantees its making and its origin.\n\nAfter your visit, the \"Pèlerin Cellars”, where cheese is matured the traditional way, as well as the museum invite you to sit down at table. It is possible to taste a piece of Vacherin from the oven on site or to buy one of the countless terroir products: Gruyère, local Alpine cheese, Tomme vaudoise, goat and lamb cheese, raclette, snails, honey, cured sausages or Gentian schnapps.",
