        "abstract": "Referenced in scientific circles, the Flore-Alpe alpine garden of Champex-Lac is home to 4000 species and varieties of plants. A haven of tranquillity, it extends over one-and-a-half acres of rockeries and ornamental ponds.",
        "description": "Every summer, the Botanical alpine garden Flore-Alpe offers numerous activities: exhibitions, workshops for adults and children, excursions, plant day, open day, thematic tours, which make the visit a double pleasure. Located at the foot of Le Catogne the alpine garden is a place of serenity, offering visitors a view of the lake at Champex-Lac and the peaks of the Les Combins mountain range. Founded by the industrialist and engineer J.-M. Aubert in 1927, the garden has become an important reference in the scientific world.\n\nThe 4000 species of alpine and exotic plants find an environment favourable to their development in this one-and-a-half acre expanse of rockeries. Lulled by the sound of water, you will be able to stroll at your leisure among flowerbeds and babbling brooks.",
