It belongs to the Brefin Family, successors to Anker, and is supported by the Albert Anker House foundation; founded in 1994. The furniture and furnishings are however chiefly arranged in exactly the same manner as when Anker and his successors left the house.\n\nPrior to studying classic painting in Paris, in accordance with the wishes of his father - who followed in the footsteps of his own father as professional vet - Albert Anker studied theology. During winter months, he lived for years with his wife Anne, nee Rüfli, and later with his children in Paris. Summers were spent in the family house in Ins: where he drew the majority of his famous paintings with residents of the village as models. From 1890 on, he then lived and worked solely in this house until his death in 1910.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8033_Albert-Anker-Haus_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8033_Albert-Anker-Haus_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8033_Albert-Anker-Haus_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Albert Anker-Haus","name_2":null,"street":"Müntschemiergasse 7","zip":"3232","place":"Ins","tel":"+41 (0)58 327 24 30","fax":null,"email":"info@albert-anker.ch","url1_link":"https://www.albert-anker.ch","x_coordinate":574823.9239981648,"y_coordinate":206084.19411520066,"change_date":null,"id":489,"r_key":489,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.albert-anker.ch","touristic_region":8,"canton":12}}
