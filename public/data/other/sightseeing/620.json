    "abstract": "La Vigne à Farinet (1980) is the smallest registered vineyard on Earth (1,67 m2). Originally owned by Abbé Pierre, it now belongs to the Dalai Lama. La Passerelle à Farinet (2001) is a pedestrian bridge that spans the Salentze gorge where Farinet passed away.",
    "description": "La Vigne à Farinet is made of 3 vines and each year personalities of the arts, politics or sports work the vineyard. The yearly harvest is mixed with the best Valais wine to produce one thousand bottles which are sold for a charitable cause. Access to the hill where the vineyard is planted takes less than one hour from the path Sentier des Vitraux. Along the itinerary are displayed 21 imposing art pieces of stained glass by painter Héritier and glasswork artist Imboden.\n\nThe site of the Passerelle à Farinet fascinates many by its magical setting and one understands why Farinet chose to end its days here. It is in the Salentze gorge, located between Leytron and Saillon that Gustave Courbet pained its Grotte des Géants (Cave of the Giants). The Dove that is visible on the rocks was offered by Hans Erni.",
