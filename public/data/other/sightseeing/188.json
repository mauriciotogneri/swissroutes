        "description": "Since the year of its foundation in 1954, the Musée du Léman has built up a unique collection of natural and cultural objects and documents connected to Lake Geneva and water. Its navigation collection is particularly remarkable: over 30 preserved boats and more than 150 small-scale models.\n\nThe Musée du Léman also makes visitors aware of the present-day challenges: the fight against pollution, the preservation of freshwater fauna and flora and the water quality of the lake.",
