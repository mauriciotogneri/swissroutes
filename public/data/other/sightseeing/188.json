Its navigation collection is particularly remarkable: over 30 preserved boats and more than 150 small-scale models.\n\nThe Musée du Léman also makes visitors aware of the present-day challenges: the fight against pollution, the preservation of freshwater fauna and flora and the water quality of the lake.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11401_Genfersee_Museum_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11401_Genfersee_Museum_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11401_Genfersee_Museum_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Nyon Région Tourisme","name_2":null,"street":"Avenue Viollier 8","zip":"1260","place":"Nyon","tel":"+41 (0)22 365 66 00 ","fax":null,"email":"info@nrt.ch","url1_link":"https://www.nyon-tourisme.ch","x_coordinate":507789.7869541106,"y_coordinate":137218.16744640522,"change_date":null,"id":188,"r_key":188,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.museeduleman.ch","touristic_region":9}}
