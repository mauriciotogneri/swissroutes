The modern permanent exhibition showcases the extensive archaeological heritage of the Canton of Thurgau: Lake Dwellers - Celts - Romans.","description":"During a fascinating walking tour for all ages, you can touch upon 10,000 years of the history of the Canton of Thurgau. The finds from the pile dwellings, which have been part of the UNESCO World Heritage since 2011, provide interesting information on everyday life thousands of years ago in the Lake Constance region. Highlights include Switzerland's oldest vessel made from gold, a wooden Gallo-Roman statue and a panpipe from the Roman Age. On every floor there are interactive stations where children can for instance cut beads, mint coins, dress up like Caesar and write Roman letters on wax tablets. Under the same roof you will also find the Museum of Nature, which is well worth seeing.\n\nAfter the walking tour, the museum café invites you to have a rest. In the foyer, the museum shop provides a selected range of books, picture postcards, replicas etc. Welcome to Frauenfeld where you can explore the museums!","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_GoldbecherEschenz_2013.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_GoldbecherEschenz_2013.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_HolzstatueEschenz_2009.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_Kinderprogramm_2013.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_Museum_2012.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_Museum_2014.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_PanfloeteEschenz_2005.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_MuseumFuerArchaeologie_Umgebung_2014.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","",""],"name":"Museum für Archäologie Thurgau","name_2":null,"street":"Freie Strasse 24","zip":"8510","place":"Frauenfeld","tel":"+41 (0)58 345 74 00","fax":null,"email":"archaeologie@tg.ch","url1_link":"https://www.archaeologie.tg.ch","x_coordinate":709886.3794044731,"y_coordinate":268329.1392200243,"change_date":null,"id":762,"r_key":762,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.archaeologie.tg.ch","touristic_region":2,"canton":6}}
