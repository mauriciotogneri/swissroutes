The modular pump track in Anzère is another highlight and with its rollers and turns it promises action on wheels. The skid-resistant surface is ideal for training.","description":"The Anzère pump track is located on the village square, where cars are prohibited. The 64 meter track offers several banked turns, hollows, rollers, and other bumps. Kids are certainly not the only enthusiasts. Experienced bikers will get their money’s worth when they practice their jumps here, because on this track it’s easy to quickly gain speed. \n\nIn addition to mountain bikes, BMX bikes, skateboards and inline skates can also be used. The modular pump track is made of marine plywood with fiberglass coating, which makes the surface skid-resistant. \n\nWhen you feel like taking a “pump break”, head for one of the cafés surrounding the nearby village square. \n\nSurface: synthetic \nSurface area: 400 m2","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Anzere_1_M.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Anzere_1_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/VS_Pumptrack_Anzere_2_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Anzere_1_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/VS_Pumptrack_Anzere_2_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Anzère Tourisme","name_2":null,"street":"Place du Village 8","zip":"1972","place":"Anzère","tel":"+41 (0)27 399 28 00","fax":null,"email":"info@anzere.ch","url1_link":"https://www.anzere.ch","x_coordinate":597012.3966193356,"y_coordinate":127387.4285160472,"change_date":null,"id":854,"r_key":854,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.valais.ch/en/activities/mountain-bike/pumptracks","touristic_region":11,"canton":7}}
