It boasts charming alleys and a Gothic church, which was built around 1530 on the site of a 6th century sanctuary, where a military boundary marker indicates the presence of the Romans towards 47 B.C.","description":"The history of Saint-Saphorin goes back to Roman times. The village possesses a boundary marker whose inscription dates back to 47 A.D. In those days, Saint-Saphorin was often called «Glerula» and later, in the Middle Ages, «Glérolles». It is said that «Glérolles» was completely destroyed by the waters caused by «Tauretunum» landslide.\n\nSo Bishop Marius decided to rebuild the church further up on the hill, dedicating it to Saint Symphorien, which gave Saint-Saphorin its name. The parish of Saint-Saphorin thus dates of the 6th century (530-594) A.D. It was part of the «Bishop’s land» in the Middle Ages. Sébastien de Montfalcon, the last bishop, had the current church built in 1520. He can be seen kneeling on the large stained-glass window in the church's chancel. Religious wards were also constituted during the Middle Ages.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7992_Romanische-Kirche-von-Saint-Saphorin_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7992_Romanische-Kirche-von-Saint-Saphorin_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7992_Romanische-Kirche-von-Saint-Saphorin_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Montreux-Vevey Tourisme","name_2":null,"street":"rue du Théâtre 5","zip":"1820","place":"Montreux","tel":"+41 (0)848 86 84 84","fax":null,"email":"info@montreuxriviera.com","url1_link":"https://www.montreuxriviera.com","x_coordinate":550652.883623414,"y_coordinate":147104.50081477998,"change_date":null,"id":596,"r_key":596,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.saint-saphorin.ch/saint-saphorin/paroisse/","touristic_region":9,"canton":27}}
