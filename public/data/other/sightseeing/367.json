This trail, at times hewn from the rock, is especially popular amongst avid hikers.","description":"From Sur En a natural path runs slightly uphill into the valley, of which the lower section already has a gorge-like character. After some time you reach Alp Uina Dadoura. The trail continues through the forest up to Alp Uina Dadaint.\n\nUphill through the narrowing valley and onwards into a ravine it goes. An approximately 600 m long cliff path high above the river passes through the nearly vertical rock walls, offering a unique view into the depths. After leaving the gorge you reach the pastures of Alp Sursass. From here, the trail breaks up and leads to different destinations, such as to Rims to the west.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9971_Val-d_Uina_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9971_Val-d_Uina_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9971_Val-d_Uina_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Tourismus Engadin Scuol Samnaun Val MÃ¼stair AG","name_2":null,"street":"Stradun 403a","zip":"7550","place":"Scuol","tel":"+41 (0)81 861 88 00","fax":null,"email":"info@engadin.com","url1_link":"https://www.engadin.com","x_coordinate":825001.9804438802,"y_coordinate":186537.3464439586,"change_date":null,"id":367,"r_key":367,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://scuol-zernez.engadin.com/de/regionen-entdecken/sent/val-duina","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
