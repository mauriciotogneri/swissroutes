Together with the spectacular Hammetschwand Lift, it propels the visitor to the highest point of the city of Lucerne.","description":"The panoramic Hammetschwand Lift is for those with a sense of adventure and a head for heights. It offers imposing views of the rock-face falling steeply away towards the lake. Europe’s tallest free-standing outdoor lift, it whisks its passengers in a little less than a minute to the awe-inspiring viewing terrace atop Mt. Bürgenstock. The 152.8 metre-tall lift represents one of the boldest construction feats of the \"Belle Epoque”.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8195_Hammetschwandlift-Buergenstock_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8195_Hammetschwandlift-Buergenstock_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8195_Hammetschwandlift-Buergenstock_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Nidwalden Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 1045","zip":"6371","place":"Stans","tel":"+41 (0)41 610 88 33","fax":null,"email":"info@nidwalden.com","url1_link":"https://www.nidwalden.com","x_coordinate":672822.3394024536,"y_coordinate":206002.05407890005,"change_date":null,"id":228,"r_key":228,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.buergenstock-bahn.ch","touristic_region":4,"canton":15}}
