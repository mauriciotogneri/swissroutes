        "description": "On an area of 1500 m2, two asphalt tracks offer fun for young and old. Advanced and professional riders dare to try the parallel track which is also suitable for competitions. The raised, narrow steep-wall curves and tables inviting you to jump are characteristic of the Urnäsch pump track. Beginners and children will find an ideal practice area on the separate kids’ track.\n\nWhether by mountain bike, inline skates, running wheels or roller skates - the asphalt surface can be used with any kind of non-motorised sports equipment. With its shaded visitors' zone located in the middle of the sports area right next to the gymnasium and football pitch, the facility attracts spectators from all over eastern Switzerland and invites them to come and watch.\n\nSurface: asphalt\nLength kids’ track: 52 metres\nPump track length: 182 metres",
