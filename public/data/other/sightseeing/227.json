        "description": "The Brother Klaus Museum is situated in one of Canton Obwalden’s finest townhouses. Dating from 1784, the edifice with its baroque garden is built in the French style and has retained much of its original fabric and character.\n\nThe highpoint of the permanent exhibition is the oldest known picture of Brother Klaus, which dates back to 1492. Painted on an altar panel, it was originally located in the parish church of Sachseln. The exhibition also has wall paintings from Sarnen dating from 1543, including one of the earliest portrayals of Brother Klaus.",
