Perfectly shaped and almost artistically designed it lies in the Dala gorge - a pool of spiritual power, when you consider that, at the beginning of time, water had its origin in the middle of paradise.\n\nThe trail to the waterfall and the stairs is wheelchair-accessible and flanked by spectacular insights and views.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11342_Thermalquellensteg_Dalaschlucht_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11342_Thermalquellensteg_Dalaschlucht_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11342_Thermalquellensteg_Dalaschlucht_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Leukerbad Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Rathaus","zip":"3954","place":"Leukerbad","tel":"+41 (0)27 472 71 71","fax":null,"email":"info@leukerbad.ch","url1_link":"https://www.leukerbad.ch","x_coordinate":615329.9941796387,"y_coordinate":137149.58193391917,"change_date":null,"id":178,"r_key":178,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.leukerbad.ch/adventures/summer/hiking/thermal-canyon-walk/","touristic_region":11}}
