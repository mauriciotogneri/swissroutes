It took 16 soldiers just 36 days to complete the task without machinery, using 150 cubic metres of wood, 4800 kg of screws, 3000 kg of nails, 3900 ring dowels and 132,000 wood shingles.\n\nThe endeavours replaced the first bridge, a pioneering feat erected in 1893 by Kerns-born master carpenter Josef Windlin to his own design.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8196_Hohe-Bruecke-Kerns_2a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8196_Hohe-Bruecke-Kerns_2a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8196_Hohe-Bruecke-Kerns_1b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Obwalden Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofplatz 1","zip":"6060","place":"Sarnen","tel":"+41 (0)41 666 50 40","fax":null,"email":"info@obwalden-tourismus.ch","url1_link":"https://www.obwalden-tourismus.ch","x_coordinate":663586.3407088179,"y_coordinate":192845.46521434255,"change_date":null,"id":225,"r_key":225,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":null,"touristic_region":4}}
