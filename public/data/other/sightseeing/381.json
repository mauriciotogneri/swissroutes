        "abstract": "The Königsfelden Friary has been a shining light for 700 years, with its stain-glassed church windows that are one of the highlights of European late mediaeval glass painting. Learn about the Habsburg «gateway to paradise».",
        "description": "The church and dual friary/convent was donated in 1308 in memory of the murdered German King Albert 1 of Habsburg by his widow. In addition to looking after the family memorials, the primary function of the friary lies in interceding on behalf of the dead. In mediaeval tradition the time spent by the deceased in purgatory was intended to be shortened so that he or she could be taken up into paradise as soon as possible. This was the reason why the friary was considered by the Habsburgs as the «gateway to paradise».\n\nToday, the friary houses one of the most important collections of European glass painting, with some of the windows dating from the 14th Century. There is a wide range of motifs: from members of the Founder's family, to religious saints and apostles through to a record of the pilgrims on their way through the region of Brugg to Saint Verena in Zurzach.\n\nDraw inspiration from the friary and learn more about it - a prominent witness to the former presence of the Habsburgs in Aargau.",
