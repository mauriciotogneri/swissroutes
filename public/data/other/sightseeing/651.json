    "abstract": "The Lötschepass was practically never considered, from a transport political oint of view, for developing the traffic route from Bern into the Valais and on to Italy. The link from the Gasteretal into the Lötschental was too steep and too complex.",
    "description": "The Lötschenpass never achieved the same degree of importance for traffic into the Valais as the nearby Gemmi: the Lötschental lacked a spa like that of Leukerbad at the southern foot of the Gemmi, where the hot springs were already known in Roman times.\n\nA survey was first made in 1840, which envisaged building a road into the Gasteretal valley with a tunnel to Kippel. Work on road construction was begun in the second half of the 19th century, which however only served for access to the temporary settlement in Gasteretal. Shortly before World War I it was possible to improve the road as far as Selden. One section of this link is a spectacular pass road that was blasted out of the Chluse, as the gorge is called. Masonry parapets, drystone walling, edge stones, arched bridges, tunnels and semi-galleries are incredible civil engineering feats which can still be seen today.\n\nThe experience of using this road is far more impressive than taking the unspectacular mule track route, which makes it well worthwhile walking this part of the Chluse despite the motorized traffic. The road has retained its original appearance for almost 100 years. It can thus be considered fortunate that the option of locating the Lötschberg Tunnel here was never seriously considered.",
