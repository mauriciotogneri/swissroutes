This jewel on the language border between German and French-speaking Switzerland, combines rural architecture from the two cultural zones as well as from several centuries.","description":"Jerisberghof is a delightful hamlet close to the Ferenbalm-Gurbr√º railway station. Here, one of the stately farmhouses is home to the regional Althuus Bauernmuseum, in which the farmhouse style of living between 1750 and 1900 is exhibited. Visitors view furniture and objects in the kitchen, living room and bedrooms in such a way they could well imagine the former large families returning from the fields any minute. And the art of rural crafts can also be admired. Cradled in the present-day village, this hands-on museum presents visitors the 300-year history and development of farmhouse living in a way they can touch and feel.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8025_Bauernmuseum-Althuus_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8025_Bauernmuseum-Althuus_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8025_Bauernmuseum-Althuus_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Tourismus Region Laupen","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 63","zip":"3177","place":"Laupen","tel":"+41 (0)31 740 10 60","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@regionlaupen.ch","url1_link":"https://www.regionlaupen.ch","x_coordinate":582887.5080231596,"y_coordinate":200827.08921462504,"change_date":null,"id":509,"r_key":509,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bauernmuseum.ch","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
