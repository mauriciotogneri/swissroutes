Thanks to a total of nine mountain railways, the Rigi can easily be reached from every point of the compass. A wonderful panorama of the Alps, 13 lakes and central Switzerland can be enjoyed from the peak.","description":"On 21 May 1871, Europe’s first mountain railway opened with a route from Vitznau to Rigi Staffelhöhe – a milestone in the history of the Rigi. Today, this popular excursion destination is an out and out mountain railway paradise. Located in central Switzerland and surrounded by Lake Lucerne, Lake Zug and Lake Lauerz, the Rigi can be reached from every point of the compass by seven aerial cable cars and two cogwheel railways.\n\nThe 360° panorama from Rigi Kulm (1,797 metres above sea level) is legendary. The visitor can gaze down at 13 lakes and across a distant sea of jagged peaks all the way to Germany and France. And if the view itself were not enough, the mountain offers a whole range of activities: about 120 kilometres of hiking trails, paragliding and even coach rides. Winter activities include sledging, as well as alpine and cross-country skiing. And those who indulge in nostalgia can take a trip with a steam locomotive from the turn of the century. The professionally restored coaches travel from Vitznau on Lake Lucerne to Rigi Kulm.\n\nSwitzerland’s first mountain inn was opened on the highest point of the Rigi in 1816. This event is considered to be the starting point of the evolution of the Rigi, the region and Switzerland itself as a tourist destination. The extension of the cogwheel railway to Rigi Kulm in 1873 two years after its opening prompted a further rush of visitors. Thanks to its unique location and natural scenic beauty, the Rigi remains one of the most visited mountains in Switzerland.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_2_g.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_1_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_3_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8899_Rigi_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rigi__aussicht-2.jpg_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/POI_Rigi__Betruf.jpg_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rigi_1307_Rigi_12_med_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rigi_ARB_VRB_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rigi_CL_Wanderberg_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rigi__D308127_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rigi_Zug_mit_Kuehen_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_1_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi_Bahnen_3_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/8899_Rigi_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi__aussicht-2.jpg_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/POI_Rigi__Betruf.jpg_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rigi_1307_Rigi_12_med_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rigi_ARB_VRB_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rigi_CL_Wanderberg_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rigi__D308127_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rigi_Zug_mit_Kuehen_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["GaudenzDanuser.com","","","","","(c) perretfoto.ch","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","","","Ch.Perret","","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Gäste-Service Rigi","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofstrasse 7","zip":"6410","place":"Vitznau","tel":"+41 (0)41 399 87 87","fax":null,"email":"welcome@rigi.ch","url1_link":"https://www.rigi.ch","x_coordinate":678019.6592768641,"y_coordinate":211115.3839445028,"change_date":null,"id":249,"r_key":249,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.rigi.ch/en","touristic_region":4,"canton":15}}
