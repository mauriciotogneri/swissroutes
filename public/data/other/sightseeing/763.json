Decorated with the Swiss Prix Expo and nominated for the European Museum Award, the Thurgau Museum of Nature in Frauenfeld is always worth a visit. Admission is free.","description":"Families in particular get their money's worth in the Thurgau Museum of Nature and children are given the opportunity to explore many things themselves. In true-to-life displays they can discover many local plant and animal species. Fossils bring bygone times to life, whilst a lifelike beaver lodge and living ants are among the highlights of the exhibition. If you want, you can take a musical walking tour of the exhibition with an iPod, listening not only to great songs but also solving tricky puzzles and tasks. Or you can accompany the famous English natural scientist Charles Darwin throughout the exhibition whilst becoming acquainted with the theory of evolution.\n\nIn the summer, the museum garden lets you experience nature first-hand with approximately 300 different economic and cultural plants. In addition to ancient types of corn, it showcases vegetable and fruit plants, rare field herbs, important medicinal and seasoning herbs and once indispensable dyeing plants. Both the museum and the garden are unobstructed.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Dauerausstellung_2011.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Dauerausstellung_2011.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Dauerausstellung_2006_1.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Dauerausstellung_2006_2.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Lebende_Ameisen_2011.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Frauenfeld_Naturmuseum_Umgebung_2014.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","",""],"name":"Naturmuseum Thurgau","name_2":null,"street":"Freie Strasse 24","zip":"8510","place":"Frauenfeld","tel":"+41 (0)58 345 74 00","fax":null,"email":"naturmuseum@tg.ch","url1_link":"https://www.naturmuseum.tg.ch","x_coordinate":709866.7019711366,"y_coordinate":268294.2984978846,"change_date":null,"id":763,"r_key":763,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.naturmuseum.tg.ch","touristic_region":2}}
