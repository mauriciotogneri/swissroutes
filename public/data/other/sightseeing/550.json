        "abstract": "Aventicum, the former capital of Roman Switzerland, had nearly 20,000 inhabitants at the beginning of our era. Today, it is one of the most important archeological sites in Switzerland, with several monuments that bear witness to its past grandeur.",
        "description": "After the Roman annexation in, 15 B.C., of the territory that constitutes current Switzerland, Aventicum became the capital of the Helvets. The town was strategically placed at the centre of existing communication routes and also had access to a canal linking the outskirts of the town to the port at Lake Morat. Towards 71/72 A.D., the town was appointed the status of a colony.\n\nMost monuments that are still visible today were built after this date. Today, the Roman site in Aventicum offers visitors a great many important vestiges, such as the amphitheatre, the venue of prestigious operas, the Roman theatre, the thermae of the forum and the \"Cigognier” sanctuary, the eastern gate and the famous Tornallaz Tower, the only one of the 73 towers of the Roman fortified wall that is still intact. The excavated objects can be discovered at the Roman museum located in a medieval tower built on the amphitheatre.",
