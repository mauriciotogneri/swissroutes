Here you can bathe in the purest spring water.","description":"This recreation centre in the beautiful Lumnezia mountains is alive with the beauty and uniqueness of nature. A former «Nackental lake», which over the course of millions of years had turned into a fen, has been partially excavated and sealed with natural materials. A near-natural lake was thus created.\n\nIn summer a large wading pool offers children exactly what they want - splashing, sloshing, wading and boating for all it's worth. A little brook with small waterfalls and ponds, inviting children to spend time exploring it and playing cheerful games, winds right through the middle of the terraced lawns.\n\nOn warm days a small tent village made up of hikers, cyclists and guests wanting to exchange their hotel room with a sleeping bag for a few nights, comes into being behind the hills in Davos Munts. With the construction of a beach volleyball court made of real sand the summer sports trend was catered for.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts _1b.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts _1b.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts_2a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts_4a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts_3a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_Badesee Davos Munts_5a.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","",""],"name":"Badesee Davos Munts","name_2":null,"street":"Lag Davos Munts 190A","zip":"7146","place":"Vattiz","tel":"+41 (0)79 611 02 11","fax":null,"email":"contact@davosmunts.ch","url1_link":"http://www.davosmunts.ch","x_coordinate":731168.653403339,"y_coordinate":174392.40681516437,"change_date":null,"id":3371,"r_key":3371,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.davosmunts.ch","touristic_region":1,"canton":2}}
