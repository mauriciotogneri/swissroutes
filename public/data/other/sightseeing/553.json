Nostalgic experiences - in Goms, of course.","description":"Marvel at the pioneering engineering feats of our ancestors in the midst of a grandiose mountain landscape.\n\nFirst, the soon-to-be 100-year-old steam engine climbs up the mountain on the meter-gauge cog rail alongside the rushing waters of the Furkareuss.\n\nAt the first stop in Tiefenbach you can dip your hand into the water. With a full steam boiler, the train continues through the Alp meadows teeming with wildflowers. Then there is an extended stop at Bahnhof Furka, the highest station (2,160 m above sea level). After that, the train rolls without the aid of cogs through the 1,874-meter Scheitel tunnel at a gentle descent toward Valais.\n\nYou will experience a special spectacle of nature and engineering while viewing the celebrated Rhone Glacier, which soon reveals itself to passengers between snow-covered peaks.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8065_Dampfbahn-Furka-Bergstrecke_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8065_Dampfbahn-Furka-Bergstrecke_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8065_Dampfbahn-Furka-Bergstrecke_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Obergoms Tourismus AG","name_2":null,"street":"Furkastrasse 53","zip":"3985","place":"MÃ¼nster","tel":"+41 (0)27 974 68 68","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@obergoms.ch","url1_link":"https://www.obergoms.ch","x_coordinate":669752.0954382453,"y_coordinate":154110.88582999218,"change_date":null,"id":553,"r_key":553,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.dfb.ch","touristic_region":11,"canton":7}}
