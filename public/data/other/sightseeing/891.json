The jumps vary in size. How about a wood chips landing? Go ahead, try it!","description":"The Steffisburg fun park is one of the most popular dirt parks in Switzerland. The facility offers 16 jumps, a wood chips landing, and a large construction similar to a ski jump for agile manoeuvres in the form of a quarter pipe. \n\nThe jumps are split between four lines and offer much variety. It is an excellent training opportunity for both beginners and advanced riders. The “Dirt Offspring Series” stops here every year and the “Dirt King” event also takes place in Steffisburg. A bike school is available during the summer. \n\nTake the bike path at Sonnenfeldstrasse to get to the Steffisburg dirt park.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_1_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_1_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_2_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_3_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_1_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_2_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/BE_Dirtpark_Steffisburg_3_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","",""],"name":"Bikepark Thunersee","name_2":null,"street":"Untere Trüelmatt 4","zip":"3624","place":"Goldiwil","tel":"+41 (0)33 221 04 04","fax":null,"email":"marketing@bikepark-thunersee.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bikepark-thunersee.ch","x_coordinate":613651.5100057024,"y_coordinate":179856.7820633351,"change_date":null,"id":891,"r_key":891,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.facebook.com/DirtParkSteffisburg","touristic_region":6}}
