Leave your worries far behind and enjoy the scenic panorama of the Bernina massif and the glacier in peace.","description":"The journey starts out in a most delightful way when you take the Rhaetian Railway along the Bernina line. Then the large cabins of the cable car carry you up to the mountain station at 2978 m above sea level and into the heart of the Alpine world. Here you are greeted majestically by Piz Pal√º and its three peaks, at whose feet the Morteratsch Glacier flows down to the valley like a silver beard.\n\nAt an altitude of 3000 metres you can enjoy the highest jacuzzi in Europe or, from the restaurant, unique views over the Bernina massif and the Morteratsch and Pers glaciers.\n\nSo beautiful is it here that merely taking in the panorama from a deck chair is already enough. But of course the Diavolezza also has many activities on offer, from summer snow sport to high mountain tours and glacier hikes.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8868_Diavolezza_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8868_Diavolezza_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8868_Diavolezza_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Pontresina Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Via Maistra 133","zip":"7504","place":"Pontresina","tel":"+41 (0)81 838 83 00","fax":null,"email":"pontresina@engadin.ch","url1_link":"https://www.engadin.stmoritz.ch/pontresina","x_coordinate":794185.8882617401,"y_coordinate":143213.2130694847,"change_date":null,"id":341,"r_key":341,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.graubuenden.ch/de/sommerurlaub/genussurlaub/natur/berge/aussichtsberge-und-gletscher/diavolezza-pontresina.html","touristic_region":1}}
