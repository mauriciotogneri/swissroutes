The curious can experiment at more than 500 interactive stations. Become the scientist!","description":"At Technorama the \"wow effect\" fully kicks in, no matter whether you are a professor or whether changing a light bulb is as far as your technical capabilities will go: suddenly you realise that natural science and technology are incredible fun. Whilst you explore, marvel, try out and understand you soon turn into a scientist yourself.\n\nBesides the interactive exhibits you will also find shows and presentations on the daily schedule. The spacious self-service restaurant provides you with refreshments. If you prefer to bring your own sandwiches, you may use one of the picnic areas in the building or take a stroll in the park, where barbecue areas are also available.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8933_Technorama_The-Swiss-Science-Center_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8933_Technorama_The-Swiss-Science-Center_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8933_Technorama-The-Swiss-Science-Center_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Technorama - The Swiss Science Center","name_2":null,"street":"Technoramastrasse 1","zip":"8404","place":"Winterthur","tel":"+41 (0)52 244 08 44","fax":null,"email":"info@technorama.ch","url1_link":"https://www.technorama.ch","x_coordinate":699847.3479261382,"y_coordinate":263423.55801787775,"change_date":null,"id":206,"r_key":206,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://winterthur.com/de/winterthur-entdecken/erlebnisse/technorama.html","touristic_region":3}}
