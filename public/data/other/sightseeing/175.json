Let the impressive ice sculptures lure you back to the Ice Age.","description":"Discover mystical, icy worlds in the highest glacier palace in the world. You arrive at the glacier palace with one of the 2 lifts directly from the Matterhorn glacier paradise station. You then walk into the palace through an ice tunnel that is almost fifteen metres below the surface of the glacier. Adventurers and daredevils can return by walking through a glacier crevasse.\n\nDiscreet lighting and ethereal sounds accompany you through a minor wonder of the world of glaciers. Information about the creation of the glacier palace, glaciology and impressive statues sculpted from ice round off an experience of a very special kind. The sculptures are regularly renewed.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11395_Gletscher_Palast_Zermatt_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11395_Gletscher_Palast_Zermatt_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11395_Gletscher_Palast_Zermatt_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Zermatt Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofplatz 5","zip":"3920","place":"Zermatt","tel":"+41 (0)27 966 81 00","fax":null,"email":"info@zermatt.ch","url1_link":"https://www.zermatt.ch","x_coordinate":622483.1818984046,"y_coordinate":87370.24979833819,"change_date":null,"id":175,"r_key":175,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.matterhornparadise.ch/en/winter/mountain-adventures/matterhorn-glacier-paradise","touristic_region":11,"canton":7}}
