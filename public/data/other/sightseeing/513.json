        "description": "The \"Moulins de Rivaz\" Foundation, which is located between Lausanne and Montreux, proudly presents the \"Lavaux Vinorama”. This venue, which is dedicated to vines and wine located in the heart of the Lavaux terraced vineyards (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), is one of a kind. A vintner family’s working life in Lavaux was filmed for a year. The result has been made into a film in eight languages. It constitutes the top event of this exceptional place. In addition, \"Lavaux Vinorama” proposes three hundred regional wines that can be tasted and bought on site. Its idyllic setting offers a breathtaking view on the vineyards and the \"Forestay” cascade.",
