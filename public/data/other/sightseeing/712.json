        "abstract": "The 250 meter-long Pumptrack with jump line at the heart of the Zürichberg woods is there for your enjoyment since 2010. In these today cool surroundings, the Russians and French once battled on hot summer days way back in 1799.",
        "description": "Both big and small can wheel their way throughout the facility – and it's important to remember that bike saddles should be kept low and tyres be well pumped up. This \nPumptrack has additional entertaining elements such as seesaw and diverse widths of planks to practice balancing on etc.\n\nThe unique location way above Zürich and beneath the shady trees make this a very popular spot for an excursion in summer. Benches and places to grill are available for your convenience - along with a fountain on the Orelliweg/Hinterbergstrasse corner.\n\nThe Pumptrack is considered to originate from the European Pumptrack movement. The tracks are still arranged pretty much without an organised physical structure, something rarely seen in public facilities these days. A visit to the Zürichberg Pumptrack is therefore a must for all truly passionate Pumptrack fans!",
