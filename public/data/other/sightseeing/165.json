This adventure climb takes you through the wild, rugged gorge between Saas-Fee and Saas-Grund.","description":"Accompanied by a mountain guide who knows the area well, you climb through the frozen gorge using tyroliennes (cable pulleys), hanging bridges, ladders, iron pegs and steel cables. You climb past frozen waterfalls in a bizarre landscape of rock and ice. The highlights of the trip are riding on the exciting cable pulleys and swinging between the rocks. The experience is even more impressive at night with special headlamps. Treat yourself to an adrenaline rush. You reach Saas-Grund on foot a short time after you have left the gorge.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11353_Gorge_Alpine_Saas_Fee_1a1.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11353_Gorge_Alpine_Saas_Fee_1a1.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11353_Gorge_Alpine_Saas_Fee_2b1.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Saastal Tourismus AG","name_2":null,"street":"Obere Dorfstrasse 2","zip":"3906","place":"Saas-Fee","tel":"+41 (0)27 958 18 58","fax":null,"email":"info@saas-fee.com","url1_link":"https://www.saas-fee.ch","x_coordinate":638408.9563261118,"y_coordinate":106588.73879771393,"change_date":null,"id":165,"r_key":165,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.saas-fee.ch","touristic_region":11}}
