The Hohle Gasse is an important historic site situated in the heart of Switzerland. Originally, it was part of the trade route running from North to South.",
        "description": "According to the \"White Book of Sarnen\", William Tell shot Gessler, the Habsburg bailiff, with an arrow in the Hohlen Gasse. To commemorate the event, the William Tell chapel was built around 1530. Later an altarpiece was added. Hans Bachmann painted the death of Gessler on the façade in 1905 and the death of William Tell inside the chapel in the \"Schächenbach”. Thanks to a collection by schoolchildren (1934), an alternative access road was built, thus preserving the original location of the chapel.\n\nThe Swiss Foundation for the Protection of the Hohlen Gasse financed the restoration of this powerful symbol of the mythological roots of the Swiss Confederation in 2004/05 and also made it accessible to wheelchairs.\n\nThanks to the modern information pavilion, the entire story of Wilhelm Tell can be experienced, seen, felt and heard in the Hohlen Gasse. The information is available in five languages.",
