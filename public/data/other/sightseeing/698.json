        "abstract": "On the largest playground in Eastern Switzerland you can climb, slide, swing and jump on 10 different play islands, and in between relax comfortably.",
        "description": "When choosing the playground equipment it was made sure that a wide range of different needs were met for the children playing there. The bird's nest swing, the zip slide, the aerial bridge, the pirate ship, the hammock and the ground-level trampoline are all elements that can also be well used by children with disabilities, so that they can play with their siblings and friends.\n\nOther playground equipment, like the belt trampoline and the wobbly bridge, as well as the speaking tube, the barefoot path, the open fountain and the sand and water area all serve to strengthen the sensory perceptions of the children.\n\nSo that everyone can reach the meeting place, all entrances, as well as the entire path network to the individual game islands, are barrier-free. It also makes access easier for people with a pram or older people with walking aids, so that they can accompany their children or grandchildren to the playground.",
