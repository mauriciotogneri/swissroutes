        "description": "The Schloss Sargans is a proud witness to the local history of Sarganserland. The palace embodies two hundred years of earldom and more than three hundred years of varied bailiff rule. The citizens of Sargans bought the dilapidated building at the end of the 19th century and saved it from complete ruin with a number of renovations.\n\nThe old count’s palace is now home to one of the most important local history museums in Europe. It was the first Swiss museum to be given the \"Museum of the Year” award by the Council of Europe in 1983, and in 1987 it was added to the list of the world’s 37 most recommended museums.\n\nThe splendid view, the restaurant with historical rooms, the secluded courtyard and the wonderful cellar with its antique wine press all make a trip to the former headquarters of the Landvogtei (bailiwick) an unforgettable experience.",
