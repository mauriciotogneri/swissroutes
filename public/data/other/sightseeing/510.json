However, today the Flühlenmühle mill is the last of its kind in the wild and romantic Flüebachgraben - and a bill of sale dating back as far as 1507 permits us concluding that the Flühlenmühle has been in operation since over 500 years in the very same spot. A foundation has set itself the task of preserving the building and keeping the centuries-old tradition alive, and the stone and wheel continues to grind even today.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8024_Fluehlenmuehle_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8024_Fluehlenmuehle_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8024_Fluehlenmuehle_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Tourismus Region Laupen","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 63","zip":"3177","place":"Laupen","tel":"+41 (0)31 990 60 61","fax":null,"email":"tourismus@regionlaupen.ch","url1_link":"https://www.regionlaupen.ch","x_coordinate":585673.2918691288,"y_coordinate":197961.51164434463,"change_date":null,"id":510,"r_key":510,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.fluehlenmuehle.ch","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
