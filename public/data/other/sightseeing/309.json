Pietro and Paolo","abstract":"The 11th century church of Saints Peter and Paul, situated above the town of Biasca, is in Romanesque style and its interior is decorated with numerous frescoes and sculptures dating back many centuries.","description":"The church of Saints Peter and Paul dates from the 11th century and is considered one of the finest Romanesque monuments in Switzerland. The church towers majestically above the town of Biasca looking towards the entrances to the three Ambrosian valleys (Blenio, Leventina and Riviera). A long flight of steps leads up to the splendid monument, built atop a rock at the foot of the mountainside above the town. The church was restored between the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. Its three naves date from the 11th century and it is decorated with numerous priceless frescoes created between the 12th and 17th centuries, which are a great attraction for visitors. Several proto-Romanesque sculptures and a 17th century Baroque chapel further attest to the long history of this national monument.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9279_Kirche-SS.-Pietro-und-Paolo_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9279_Kirche-SS.-Pietro-und-Paolo_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9279_Kirche-SS.-Pietro-und-Paolo_3b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bellinzonese e Alto Ticino Turismo","name_2":null,"street":"Casa Cavalier Pellanda 4","zip":"6710","place":"Biasca","tel":"+41 (0)91 862 33 27","fax":null,"email":"biasca@bellinzonese-altoticino.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bellinzonese-altoticino.ch","x_coordinate":718120.3174218477,"y_coordinate":135415.95056657217,"change_date":null,"id":309,"r_key":309,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.bellinzonese-altoticino.ch/en/commons/details/2844.html","touristic_region":12}}
