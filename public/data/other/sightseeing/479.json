Michel, the last Count, found himself in financial dire straits and declared bankruptcy in 1554. The creditors - the towns of Fribourg and Berne - shared his land between them. The Castle would serve as the prefects' residence until 1848. It was then put up for sale in 1849 and was bought by the Bovy-Ballands, a wealthy family from Geneva, as a summer residence. Over the years they restored the castle with help from their artist friends. In 1938, the canton of Fribourg bought back the Castle and turned it into a museum.\n\nDiscover the Castle's permanent exhibitions that serve as a reminder of its history, in addition to various temporary exhibitions.\n\nGruyères is a thrilling 18-minute long multimedia show (images, music, light and sound). Available in 8 languages, the show takes the visitor on a voyage of exploration through the castle’s eventful history. Shown every day, every 30 minutes.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7977_Schloss-Greyerz_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7977_Schloss-Greyerz_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/7977_Schloss-Greyerz_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Fribourg Region","name_2":null,"street":"Route de la Glâne 107","zip":"1701","place":"Fribourg","tel":"+41 (0)26 407 70 20","fax":null,"email":"information@fribourgregion.ch","url1_link":"https://www.fribourgregion.ch","x_coordinate":572837.8063710562,"y_coordinate":159335.0317556364,"change_date":null,"id":479,"r_key":479,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.chateau-gruyeres.ch","touristic_region":13,"canton":5}}
