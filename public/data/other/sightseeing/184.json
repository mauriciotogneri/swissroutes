        "abstract": "Opened in the year 2000 in Champoussin, Point Sud was Switzerland's first suspension rope park. Point Sud offers you the possibility of seeing the forest in a new way. Accessible to all, the park proposes a fun activity between sport and a walk in the nature.",
        "description": "More than 400 meters long, this park boasts 34 platforms and 31 different fixed, moving or suspended passages. The course will surprise you with suspension bridges, lianas, zip lines, knotted ropes, etc.\n\nAlthough being constantly secured, you won't be able to avoid all adrenaline rush. Point Sud is a fun activity but it also gives you the possibility of reaching personal goals such as personal development, overcoming your limits, developing agility, strengthening your physical condition and balance… all of this being close to nature.\n\nAt Point Sud, there are also 2 courses for children. The mini course for children of 3 to 5 years of age and the junior course for children of 6 to 10 years of age. Point Sud is the Chablais’ first adventure park situated in altitude (1'600m). Point Sud consists of progressing in altitude and seeing exceptional points of views from the trees.",
