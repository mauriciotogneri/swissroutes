In planning the route, natural conditions were taken into consideration and the trail adapted to the existing terrain.","description":"The trail begins at the postbus stop in Oberschwanden and first leads on the right, then the left of the Lammbach stream, down through the forest to the crossroads in Kienholz - a section 1200 metres long with 140 metres height difference. It leads over rough terrain that also incorporates humps and pools, ramps, jumps, exciting crossovers and steep turns.\n\nHiking and biking trails are clearly separated along the entire route between Oberschwanden and Kienholz. The Lammbach stream has a bridge for hikers and a ford for freeriders. Special obstacle bypasses also offer less experienced bikers an easier ride on the bike trail. Great attention is given to information and safety.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_4_web.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_1_web.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_4_web.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Biketrail_Schwanden_Brienz_2014_5_web.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","",""],"name":"Verein IG Bergvelo","name_2":null,"street":"Kirchg√§ssli 1","zip":"3800","place":"Matten b.
