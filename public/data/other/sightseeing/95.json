        "description": "Around 720 a small settlement was established. Being situated at the foot of the Lukmanier pass, the region experienced many conflicts throughout the middle ages. Even today within the foundations are two 8th century churches. Documents show, that in 1285 the monastery had added a school. Later between 1683 and 1704 a major baroque monastery was built on the same site.\n\nThe monastery museum is well worth a visit. A history of the abbey, its religious art, as well as an exhibition of crystals and minerals from the region are on display. Visitors are also welcome to the daily prayers, or to come to the Eucharist. An opportunity also exists for men to a take time out within the life of the monastery. In today's world a rare opportunity indeed!",
