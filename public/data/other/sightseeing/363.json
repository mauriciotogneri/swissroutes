The Chestnut Festival is held in honour of the chestnut in October every year.\n\nThe treetops are intertwined, forming long columned halls in which the atmosphere is as solemn as in a cathedral. On the new Chestnut Trail in Castasegna, many interesting facts about this typical Bergell product wait to be discovered. Nature is experienced in a very special way on this one hour walk through the «Selve» – the forests – during the period when the chestnuts are ripening.\n\nOn 5 information boards along the way, visitors learn general facts about chestnuts and chestnut forests.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9898_Edelkastanienwald-Bergell_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9898_Edelkastanienwald-Bergell_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9898_Edelkastanienwald-Bergell_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bregaglia Engadin Turismo","name_2":null,"street":"Strada cantonale 140","zip":"7605","place":"Stampa","tel":"+41 (0)81 822 15 55","fax":null,"email":"info@bregaglia.ch","url1_link":"https://www.bregaglia.ch","x_coordinate":760426.0169305555,"y_coordinate":133850.00170802826,"change_date":null,"id":363,"r_key":363,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.castagneto.ch/kastanienwald.htm","touristic_region":1}}
