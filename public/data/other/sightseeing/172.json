The numerous twists, turns and \"dragons' dens\" (tunnels), promise fast fun from May to October with each run a memorable and exciting experience. And when you reach the end, the lift pulls you gently back up to the start. You prefer things a little slower? No problem – your speed is in your hands.\n\n10  exercise trails with varying degrees of difficulty:\r\n10 exercise trails through forest, each with 6 to 11 stations in varying degrees of difficulty, the Pilatus Rope Park offers a fun experience for outdoor fans, families, schools, companies and clubs. One trail is suitable for our smaller guests from age 8. Around 100 visitors will be able to test their rope skills at the same time.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8897_Pilatus-Seilpark-Sommerrodelbahn_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8897_Pilatus-Seilpark-Sommerrodelbahn_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8897_Pilatus-Seilpark-Sommerrodelbahn_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Luzern Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofstrasse 3","zip":"6002","place":"Luzern","tel":"+41 (0)41 227 17 17","fax":null,"email":"luzern@luzern.com","url1_link":"https://www.luzern.com","x_coordinate":661896.3543491288,"y_coordinate":204690.26877427535,"change_date":null,"id":172,"r_key":172,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.pilatus.ch/content-n136-sE.html","touristic_region":4,"canton":10}}
