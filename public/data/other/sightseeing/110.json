    "abstract": "The Neeracher Ried mire has the Linth glacier to thank for its existence. The glacier created a relief that facilitated the formation of extensive mire landscapes. The traditional utilization of the mire continues today, thus the region retains its ecological value.",
    "description": "During the last Ice Age, the Linth Glacier advanced from the Glarnerland region east of Zurich into the Zurich lowlands leaving behind a textbook relief: gently undulated ground moraines, lateral moraines and two dead-ice depressions (Lake Stadler, Lake Chernensee).\n\nThe Neeracher Ried mire is located in the middle of this area and is one of north Switzerland’s largest blanket mires. The mire landscape is rich in flora species and a significant breeding area for water and mire birds.\n\nTraditional mire management and litter removal (Streunutzung) are still in practised there today. This involves draining mire and irrigating it again on a seasonal basis. Scottish highland cows graze on a small part of the mire from spring until autumn. Several busy roads which cross the mire are problematic.\n\n# Nature reserves and landscape protection areas\n\nA large part of this area is listed, inter alia, in the following federal inventories:\n\n# Other links\n\n",
