It has inspired many artists and alpinists. From the surrounding valley, it is clearly visible and easily accessible.","description":"Prior to human intervention, the waterfall of Salanfe, nicknamed «Pissevache», a pure glacier girl, was tirelessly rolling his long silver braids down the rocks. It was so strong that the water dust described by Ramuz went on the hands and faces of the numerous visitors before they had reached the height of the waterfall.\n\nGoethe, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Madame de Staël, Emile Javelle and others praised its beauty.\n\nIn 1866 a bridge hanging boldly to midheight of the fall even invited tourists (for 1 franc) to pass under it.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8160_Pissevache_Wasserfall_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8160_Pissevache_Wasserfall_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/8160_Pissevache_Wasserfall_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Commune de Vernayaz","name_2":null,"street":"Rue du Collège 10","zip":"1904","place":"Vernayaz","tel":"+41 (0)27 764 22 10","fax":null,"email":"info@vernayaz.ch","url1_link":"https://www.vernayaz.ch","x_coordinate":568280.1885652087,"y_coordinate":110367.25484291824,"change_date":null,"id":211,"r_key":211,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.valleedutrient.ch/en/wasserfall-von-pissevache-fp361","touristic_region":11}}
