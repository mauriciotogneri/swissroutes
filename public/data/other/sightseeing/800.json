The ride there on the cable car built in 2014 is spectacular as well, offering incredible scenic views of the Alps and the lakes below.","description":"The Rotenflue cable car takes you from Rickenbach above Schwyz to the nature paradise of the Mythen region at an altitude of 1571 metres. This is mainly renowned for its beautiful landscapes close to the urban settlements, for being Switzerland‘s oldest hunting ban area around the two Mythen peaks, and for its biodiversity and fantastic vistas.  \n\nThe ascent to the Rotenflue is already one of the highlights: the prealpine mountains, the lakes of Lucerne and Lauerz together with the impressive Mythen rock faces, the landmark of Schwyz, spread out before the viewer. The cable car for 8 passengers was built in 2014 and offers state-of-the-art comfort. On the top, the terrace of the homely mountain restaurant Gipfelstubli offers a great view of the Alpine peaks of Uri and Glarus. A detailed panorama drawing by an artist from Küssnacht, Peter Feusi, was mounted on the platform.  \n\nThe Mythen region can be easily reached by public transport (1 hour) or by car (40 min.) from Zug, Zurich, and Lucerne via Schwyz or Einsiedeln-Brunni. The Rotenflue is an ideal starting point for climbing the Grosser Mythen. A panoramic hiking tour, the «Mythenrundreise», leads from Rotenflue to Sattel-Hochstuckli. Those who are looking for an easy hike will enjoy the Rotenflue loop trail where they can watch the paragliders fly, make a fire at one of the barbecue picnic places, and get their fill of the spectacular views. In winter, the Mythen region offers some 50 km of ski slopes, 36 km of groomed winter hiking trails, 9 signposted snow-shoe trails, and a sledge run from the Rotenflue to the middle station «Rätigs».","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_1_g.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_10_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_11_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_1_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_2_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_3_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_4_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_5_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_6_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_7_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_8_s.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/Rotenfluebahn_9_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_10_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_11_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_1_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_2_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_3_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_4_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_5_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_6_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_7_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_8_g.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Rotenfluebahn_9_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["REMO INDERBITZIN  remoinderbitzin.com","BILD REMO INDERBITZIN","","","","","","","","","BILD REMO INDERBITZIN"],"photo_gallery_author":["REMO INDERBITZIN","REMO INDERBITZIN","","","","","","","","","REMO INDERBITZIN"],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","","","","","","","","",""],"name":"Rotenfluebahn Mythenregion AG","name_2":null,"street":"Rickenbachstrasse 163","zip":"6432","place":"Rickenbach","tel":"+41 (0)41 810 70 00","fax":null,"email":"rotenflue@mythenregion.ch","url1_link":"https://www.mythenregion.ch","x_coordinate":693575.3769610346,"y_coordinate":207817.96050427612,"change_date":null,"id":800,"r_key":800,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.rotenfluebahn.ch","touristic_region":4,"canton":11}}
