This robust cow has the particularity of being a natural fighter in order to establish the hierarchy within the herd. In springtime, they challenge each other to see who will be their leader.","description":"The Val d'Hérens, one of the largest tributary valleys in Valais at around 20 km (12 miles) in length, is the original home of the animals that exude a sense of tradition no longer found elsewhere in Europe today. Year after year, the able-bodied, dark brown fighting cows – only the women – step into the ring to fight for supremacy within the herd and the canton.\n\nThe traditional cow fights often attract more than 15,000 spectators. The path to the final in Sion leads the rowdy cows through several heats in the tributary valleys. The winner will achieve fame not just in the canton but also across the nation.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9196_Ringkuhkaempfe-im-Wallis_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9196_Ringkuhkaempfe-im-Wallis_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9196_Ringkuhkaempfe-im-Wallis_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Wallis Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Postfach 1469, rue Pré-Fleuri 6","zip":"1951","place":"Sion","tel":"+41 (0)27 327 35 90","fax":null,"email":"info@valais.ch","url1_link":"https://www.valais.ch","x_coordinate":590225.2977164633,"y_coordinate":117236.370985869,"change_date":null,"id":315,"r_key":315,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.vacheherens.ch/","touristic_region":11}}
