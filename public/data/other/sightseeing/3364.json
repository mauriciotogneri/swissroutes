The Jungle Run slide is the longest enclosed wet slide in Europe, where you can race each other by sliding on the two tracks and measuring your time.\n\nThe tropical plants in the wave pool and at the slides make you feel like you're on a beach holiday the whole year round. Let yourself drift away is the motto of the Rio Mare river flow and you can relax further in the Alpa-Therme pool with whirlpool, the iodine-brine thermal spa pool or the wellness area with sauna and massage.\n\nThe large lawn with sun loungers available for you to use offers a fantastic view of Lake Zurich and the mountains.\n\nFor our youngest guests, there is a toddler area with slides, a children's paddling pool and a large selection of water-play features.","highlights":"12 adventure slides\n\nWave pool with 1.20 metre high surf waves\n\nChildren's paddling pool\n\nRiver flow, whirlpool, iodine-brine spa pool\n\nFitness and wellness area with sauna and steam bath\n\nShowers, toilet facilities, drinking water\n\n2 restaurants","foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_AlpamareWasserparkPfaeffikon_1b_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_AlpamareWasserparkPfaeffikon_4_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Baden_AlpamareWasserparkPfaeffikon_1b_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Baden_AlpamareWasserparkPfaeffikon_1b_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Alpamare Wasserpark","name_2":null,"street":"Gwattstrasse 12","zip":"8808","place":"Pfäffikon","tel":"+41 (0)55 415 15 15","fax":null,"email":"alpamare@alpamare.ch","url1_link":"http://www.alpamare.ch","x_coordinate":702472.0739009135,"y_coordinate":228465.50131842645,"change_date":null,"id":3364,"r_key":3364,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.alpamare.ch","touristic_region":3}}
