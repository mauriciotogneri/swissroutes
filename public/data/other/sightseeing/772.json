You can learn to master the rides in narrow curves and over waves. It’s a track for all generations. \n\nDue to a tarmac surface, the track is weatherproof and can be used all year, except during snowfall.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/zweisimmen_pumptrack_2016_1.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/zweisimmen_pumptrack_2016_1.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/zweisimmen_pumptrack_2016_2.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/zweisimmen_pumptrack_2016_3.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/zweisimmen_pumptrack_2016_4.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["","","",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["","","",""],"name":"Pumptrack Zweisimmen","name_2":null,"street":"Gewerbestrasse 10a","zip":"3770","place":"Zweisimmen","tel":"+41 (0)33 722 11 33","fax":null,"email":"info@pumptrack-zweisimmen.ch","url1_link":"https://www.zweisimmen.ch","x_coordinate":595347.9353333022,"y_coordinate":155657.83820007357,"change_date":null,"id":772,"r_key":772,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.zweisimmen.ch/Tourismus%20und%20Sport/Pumptrack%20Zweisimmen","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
