        "abstract": "Franz Gertsch is one of Switzerland's principal contemporary artists. After his start with romantic paintings, Gertsch began his transition in 1965, creating collages in the pop-art style and then large-format, photo-realistic paintings and woodcuts.",
        "description": "Works from the Willy Michel Foundation – consisting of an endowment by the museum's founder, Willy Michel, and donations from Franz Gertsch himself – form the basis of the museum's collection. It encompasses nearly the complete works of Franz Gertsch from the period 1987 to 2004. In particular, these include the portrait of Silvia I and the large-format paintings Gräser l-V (Grasses I-IV).\n\nThe collection also focuses on woodcuts by Franz Gertsch, including the monumental installation Das Grosse Gras (The Big Grass), composed of four triptychs, each measuring 400 x 850 cm; various works from the Schwarzwasser series (two triptychs, one diptych and Schwarzwasser I); and the most recent monumental woodcut, Maria.\n\nThe museum complements its own collection with borrowed works from other museums and private lenders, and it endeavors to enhance its own collection through the acquisition of further works.",
