The terrace high above the Rhine behind the cathedral is called the Pfalz because the residence of the Bishop of Basel once was in the immediate vicinity. Through a narrow gate one passes from the terrace into the quiet cloister of the Basel cathedral. Here one finds richly ornamented gravestones of members of well-known Basel families dating from the 16th to the 19th century.\n\nStairs lead down from the Pfalz to the landing stage of the ferry boat (Münsterfähre). The ferry is attached to a wire rope stretched across the Rhine, and is propelled across the broad river purely by the force of the current. There are three other ferries in Basel, and all of them are a popular attraction for both young and old.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8172_Pfalz_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8172_Pfalz_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8172_Pfalz_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Basel Tourismus Tourist Information","name_2":null,"street":"Steinenberg 14","zip":"4010","place":"Basel","tel":"+41 (0)61 268 68 68","fax":null,"email":"info@basel.com","url1_link":"https://www.basel.com","x_coordinate":611599.2829906669,"y_coordinate":267353.00611275475,"change_date":null,"id":565,"r_key":565,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.basel.com/de/Media/Attraktionen/Sehenswuerdigkeiten/Pfalz","touristic_region":5,"canton":8}}
