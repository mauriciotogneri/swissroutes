Four minutes before the strokes announcing the change of hour, a cock crows, the bear commences his rounds and the joker takes the liberty of announcing the hour in advance.","description":"The clock tower represents the first western city gate (1191 -1256) and forms the boundary of the first city expansion. Today, it's a real crowd-puller, and one of the main attractions in Berne. The ornate astronomical calendar and clock works were created as long ago as 1530.\n\nThe clock served as master clock in Berne, and thus all evolved around this clock and point. From here, distances were measured to various places and recorded on stones along the roads of the canton. And on passing through the gate, you view the measurements originally stated in Elle and fathoms - and today in feet and double-meters, as measurement for public scrutiny.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8027_Zytglogge_Bern_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8027_Zytglogge_Bern_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8027_Zytglogge_Bern_b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Bern Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Bahnhofplatz 10a","zip":"3011","place":"Bern","tel":"+41 (0)31 328 12 12","fax":null,"email":"info@bern.com","url1_link":"https://www.bern.com","x_coordinate":600700.2118932322,"y_coordinate":199651.76121140615,"change_date":null,"id":508,"r_key":508,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"http://www.bern.com/de/stadt-bern/sehenswuerdigkeiten/zeitglockenturm","touristic_region":6,"canton":12}}
