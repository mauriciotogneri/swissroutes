Thanks to its asphalt surface, it can be ridden in any weather. ","description":"The 1650 m2 pump track in Steckborn is located directly in front of the school building. Because its curves are not very high or steep, it is ideally suited for children. But with several loops that can be combined and elements that invite you to jump, experts will also get their money's worth. \n\nThanks to the asphalt, the pump track is completely weatherproof, although it can become slippery when wet. However, it dries in a good 30 minutes and can then be used again. It is also suitable for inline skates, scooters and skateboards.\n\nSurface: Asphalt\nArea: 1650 m2\nLength: 350 metres\nWave and curve height: 30-100 cm  \n","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/TG_Pumptrack_Steckborn_1_M.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/TG_Pumptrack_Steckborn_1_M.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/TG_Pumptrack_Steckborn_2_M.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Bike Club Steckborn","name_2":null,"street":"Primarschule Steckborn","zip":"8266","place":"Steckborn","tel":"-","fax":null,"email":"-","url1_link":"https:// www.pedaleure.ch","x_coordinate":716065.608944489,"y_coordinate":280401.6323216148,"change_date":null,"id":813,"r_key":813,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.pedaleure.ch","touristic_region":2}}
