This unique path has been designed for walking in your bare feet. It's located directly next to the chairlift.","description":"What a sensational pleasure it is to walk barefoot along this path lined with changing textures: sand, wood chips, gravel, soft clay, pools of water. The different materials provide unique tactile stimulation for your feet: soft and smooth, prickly and tickly, rough, uneven, wet and dry. Give your tired feet a treat after a long hike. This is relaxation and revitalization at its best. As they say - happy feet, happy heart.\n\nBrunni Alpine Herb Paths. Yet another highlight of the Brunni: two medicinal herb paths. The wisdoms and secrets of Alpine natural healing have been cultivated and handed down for generations. Along two different native plant paths - one around Lake Härzlisee, the other located just beyond the chairlift area — you can study the various healing herbs in their natural environment.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9827_Kitzelpfad-Brunni_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9827_Kitzelpfad-Brunni_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/9827_Kitzelpfad-Brunni_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Engelberg-Titlis Tourismus AG","name_2":null,"street":"Klosterstrasse 3","zip":"6390","place":"Engelberg","tel":"+41 (0)41 639 77 77","fax":null,"email":"welcome@engelberg.ch","url1_link":"https://www.engelberg.ch/","x_coordinate":674158.0006284353,"y_coordinate":188274.0011204052,"change_date":null,"id":246,"r_key":246,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.brunni.ch/sommer-angebot/kitzelpfad.html","touristic_region":4,"canton":null}}
