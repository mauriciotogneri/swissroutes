        "description": "The well-known stamp engraver, artist and designer created the monument during 25 years as a recluse with great self-discipline, given his social and material isolation. The Paxmal (peace monument) is not a place of worship but a quiet, peaceful locale for collecting your thoughts, contemplation and meditation.\n\nThe left wall of the monument depicts earthly life: a human couple in its existence and development, love and procreation. The right wall is dedicated to spiritual life: the awakening, toiling, seeing and evolving humankind. This incomparable work of art stimulates meditation and reflection upon ourselves and our social systems on the way to becoming all-embracing, creative and good human beings.",
