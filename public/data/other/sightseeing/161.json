        "abstract": "The most interesting feature in Saint-George is doubtlessly its glacier cave, one of the most reputed unusual sights in the entire Jura of the Lake Geneva Region. Part of this 22 m deep glacier cave is accessible via two ladders. The cave can be visited from Mid-May to Mid-November.",
        "description": "For security reasons and because of permanent compression of the lower ice layer, access to the bottom of the abyss is no longer possible. Standing on the lower bridge, particularly in spring, visitors can see the bottom and the walls of the glacier cave of a length of 20 m and a width of 12 m.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, this glacier cave was exploited by a Lausanne-based company which supplied ice to local brasseries. The ice was transported by horse at night to prevent the ice from melting.",
