Those wishing to reach this renowned tourist destination, may do so from May to November using the cable lift that from Rivera takes to Alpe Foppa.\n\nAt Alpe Foppa, where the cable lift arrives, there's a hospitable and well-supplied restaurant. There's also a playground for smaller children available. Right in front of the Alpine glade there's a little lake that makes the area even more attractive. Between Alpe Foppa and the summit of Mount Tamaro, open from June to October, one finds the Capanna Tamaro. An especially attractive destination is the S. Maria degli Angeli Church, designed by the famous architect Mario Botta. This is a very innovative kind of building of worship.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8128_Monte-Tamaro_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8128_Monte-Tamaro_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/8128_Monte-Tamaro_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Ente Turistico del Luganese","name_2":null,"street":"Palazzo Civico - Piazza della Riforma","zip":"6900","place":"Lugano","tel":"+41 (0)58 220 65 00","fax":null,"email":"info@luganoregion.com","url1_link":"https://www.luganoregion.com","x_coordinate":712506.957744091,"y_coordinate":108415.42111314459,"change_date":null,"id":523,"r_key":523,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.montetamaro.ch/en/","touristic_region":12,"canton":19}}
