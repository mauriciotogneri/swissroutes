Opened in the summer of 2018, the park even boasts a world first – the «Doppelgugelhopf».","description":"The Saanen Bank pump park at the Oeyetli youth centre between Saanen and Gstaad complements the existing skate park. Its 900 square metre area is fully paved. This playground gives cracks of all ages countless opportunities to use gravity as they freely make their way through the jumps, rollers and banked turns.\n\nThe highlight of this facility, which opened in the summer of 2018, is the \"Doppelgugelhopf\" element at the centre, currently the only one of its kind in the world. It comprises two Gugelhopf-like forms, arranged one inside the other: a small steep Gugelhopf surrounded by a somewhat flatter one.\n\nThe special asphalt mixture suppresses noise and ensures a good grip. For this reason, the park is not only suitable for mountain bikes and BMX bikes, but also for inline skates, skateboards and kickboards.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9241_g.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9086_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9241_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9245_s.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9258_s.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9086_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9241_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9245_g.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image-big/Pumptrack_SaaneN_IMG_9258_g.jpg"],"photo_gallery_copyright":["","","",""],"photo_gallery_author":["","","",""],"name":"Jugendzentrum Oeyetli","name_2":null,"street":"Oeyetliweg 30","zip":"3792","place":"Saanen","tel":"+41 (0)79 820 39 32","fax":null,"email":"info@jugasaanen.ch","url1_link":"https://www.jugasaanen.ch","x_coordinate":586867.0643483779,"y_coordinate":148179.02165641222,"change_date":null,"id":726,"r_key":726,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.jugasaanen.ch/","touristic_region":6}}
