However, this little village has brought forth exceptional wine: with neighbouring Oberhallau Gächlingen and Trasadingen it produces the largest share of the region's wine! 389 hectares of vineyards cover Hallau like a colourful king's robe in autumn. St. Moritz's, the  mountain church, stands proudly high above the vineyards, it is an eye-catching landmark for the whole of the Klettgau valley.\n\nThe winegrowers cultivate Pinor Noir, Riesling x Sylvaner, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, Räuschling and Gamay x Reichensteiner in the deep and fertile soil. Full-bodied, deep red grapes grow in sun-kissed Klettgau, the largest  connected winegrowing area in German-speaking Switzerland.\n\nTip: Enjoy the Provencal-like view over the vineyards from St. Moritz's mountain church whilst sipping a refreshing fruity Schaffhausen Pinor Noir.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11328_Klettgauer_Rebenlandschaft_1a.jpg","foto_abstract":null,"photo_gallery":["https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11328_Klettgauer_Rebenlandschaft_1a.jpg","https://images.schweizmobil.ch/image/11328_Klettgauer_Rebenlandschaft_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"photo_gallery_abstract":["",""],"name":"Schaffhauserland Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Vordergasse 73","zip":"8200","place":"Schaffhausen","tel":"+41 (0)52 632 40 20","fax":null,"email":"info@schaffhauserland.ch","url1_link":"https://www.schaffhauserland.ch","x_coordinate":676727.0006013373,"y_coordinate":284060.001151519,"change_date":null,"id":151,"r_key":151,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.blauburgunderland.ch","touristic_region":2,"canton":null}}
