        "abstract": "The Engi quarry is made up of impressive tunnels and enormous caverns. For a long time, slate mining used to be performed in these tunnels. This was stopped in 1961 for health and safety and financial reasons.",
        "description": "The Stiftung Landesplattenberg (quarry foundation) was founded in 1994 with an aim to preserve the mine as an historical monument for future generations.\n\nToday, guided tours are provided through the tunnel system, where around one hour and a half is spent inside the mine. Good shoes and warm clothes are a must.\n\nIn addition, interesting fossils of fish, tortoises and birds have been an attraction for nature researchers since the 18th century. A particularly impressive treat are the concerts inside the mine. It is not only musicians who enthuse about the unique acoustics.",
