This stems from the approximately 24 m² surrounding areas – around half of which is covered in ice and snow. Spectacular sights await visitors on the inside of the mountain – and truly unique views of glacial waterfalls.\n\nThe Trümmelbach falls are of course of national significance - and naturally listed in the federal inventory as natural monument. In addition, they form a part of the UNESCO world cultural heritage and are also worthy of mention in the 3-star Guide Michelin.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9784_Truwmmelbachfaelle_3a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9784_Truwmmelbachfaelle_3a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/9784_Truemmelbachfaelle_1b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Lauterbrunnen Tourismus","name_2":null,"street":"Stutzli 460","zip":"3822","place":"Lauterbrunnen","tel":"+41 (0)33 856 85 68","fax":null,"email":"info@lauterbrunnen.swiss","url1_link":"https://www.lauterbrunnen.swiss","x_coordinate":636568.0796555335,"y_coordinate":157631.0296668434,"change_date":null,"id":410,"r_key":410,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.truemmelbachfaelle.ch/","touristic_region":6}}
