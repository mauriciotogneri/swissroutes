        "description": "The Pumptrack Weissenstein Park facility first opened in summer 2013 and lays close to the modern Hardegg living quarter and the Weissenstein sport facility, southwest of Berne. The two earthen Pumptracks came into being thanks to hours of voluntary work on behalf of the trailnet.ch association, further supported by the city of Berne.\n\nThe kid's Pumptrack is very well suited to beginners and frequently used by children with Like a Bikes, kid's bikes and all kinds of other companions on wheels! Waves, bends and hollows on the larger Pumptrack for pros support diverse riding techniques and invite you to heaps of fun and some great training. The track is open to the public and, as long as it's free of snow, is yours to enjoy year-round.\n\nSurface: earth",
