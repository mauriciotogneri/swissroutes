        "abstract": "The «Höll» caves near Baar are a very popular excursion destination - especially in bad weather - and certainly worth a visit.",
        "description": "Amid the wild romanticism of the Lorze ravine, these most beautiful limestone caves are richly adorned with calcareous formations, while miniature lakes, impressive stalagmites and stalactites in a variety of hues give each grotto its special characteristic. The various chambers, after centuries of being formed by calcareous springs, were discovered at the end of the 19th century, when a nearby quarry was mining tuff.\n\nThis underground magic is lit by electricity and the chambers are connected by good pathways. A visit lasts about 3/4 hour and is not accompanied. The caves are easily accessible by bicycle from Baar: on foot they can be reached from Baar railway station in approx. one hour and from the \"Lorzentobelbrücke\" bus stop in approx. 25 minutes. An idyllic restaurant in the woods with a large terrace (please note: closed on Mondays!) and numerous picnic places along the River Lorze are most inviting.",
