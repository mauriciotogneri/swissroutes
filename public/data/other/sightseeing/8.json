The Alpine chalet is also a vantage point that offers a breathtaking view of the Alps and Lake Geneva.\n\nAnecdote: when fridges did not yet exist, the only means of preserving the milk and its precious nutritional value consisted in transforming it into cheese. An Alpine summer pasture of the surface of a football field feeds one cow at most. Its 2,000 litres of milk can be made into 200 kg of cheese.","highlights":null,"foto":"https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11479_Fromagerie_Fruitieres_Nyon_1a.jpg","photo_gallery":["https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11479_Fromagerie_Fruitieres_Nyon_1a.jpg","https://images0.schweizmobil.ch/image/11479_Fromagerie_Fruitieres_Nyon_2b.jpg"],"photo_gallery_big":["",""],"photo_gallery_copyright":["",""],"photo_gallery_author":["",""],"name":"Office du tourisme de St-Cergue","name_2":null,"street":"Place Sy-Vieuxville 3","zip":"1264","place":"St-Cergue","tel":"+41 (0)22 360 13 14","fax":null,"email":"info@st-cergue-tourisme.ch ","url1_link":"https://www.st-cergue-tourisme.ch ","x_coordinate":501075.78903506853,"y_coordinate":146224.59898320158,"change_date":null,"id":8,"r_key":8,"type":"Sight","url_sightseeing":"https://www.st-cergue-tourisme.ch","touristic_region":9}}
